**Business Post**

Hi there, and welcome to the subreddit!

This message is to let you know that we have removed your recent thread due to being in violation of the [Rules and Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/rules), specifically this section:

****

## **Business Rules & Guidelines**


Businesses have special rules here.

1. Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) and ask for business flair. **You may NOT make any business-related posts without it.** The flair is a description that is displayed next to your username and verifies you are representing the company. It also encourages transparency. ANY business or representatives serving and promoting a business's interests are REQUIRED to have business flair.

2. After you have business flair, all business-related posts (this includes market research) **MUST** be submitted to the moderators for review prior to posting. (e.g. "I opened my own store", "I am thinking of opening my own store", etc).

3. Any businesses (or representatives serving and promoting a business' interests) posing and posting as regular users without identifying themselves with a business flair may be considered deliberately attempting to mislead the community. Misleading the community will lead to post removals and may damage your brand. If we determine the business was misleading, AB will not be able to support your business and all posts related to your business will be moderated with removal, even if posted by other users.

***

Once you have followed the necessary steps, you may be cleared to repost your thread and interact with the community as a representative of your business. Please let us know if you have any questions.

**Daily Help Thread Redirect**

Hi there! We've recently implemented a [new rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/rules) that all routine questions - from beginners to more advanced ABers looking for tweaks - should comment in the daily help thread. As such your post has been deleted.

I know it's a new thing and it'll take some getting used to, but please feel free to repost in the daily thread.

**Conduct standard violation**

Hi there! Your comment or post was removed from /r/AsianBeauty for violating our community conduct standards. Please make sure you read and follow our [conduct rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/rules#wiki_be_a_good_community_member) before commenting or posting
