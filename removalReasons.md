**No Business Post Approved**

Hi there, and welcome to the subreddit!

This message is to let you know that we have removed your recent thread due to being in violation of the [Business Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/businessrules).

****

1. Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) and ask for business flair. **You may NOT make any business-related posts without it.** The flair is a description that is displayed next to your username and verifies you are representing the company. It also encourages transparency. ANY business or representatives serving and promoting a business's interests are REQUIRED to have business flair.

2. After you have business flair, all business-related posts (this includes market research) **MUST** be submitted to the moderators for review prior to posting. (e.g. "I opened my own store", "I am thinking of opening my own store", etc).

3. Any businesses (or representatives serving and promoting a business' interests) posing and posting as regular users without identifying themselves with a business flair may be considered deliberately attempting to mislead the community. Misleading the community will lead to post removals and may damage your brand. If we determine the business was misleading, AB will not be able to support your business and all posts related to your business will be moderated with removal, even if posted by other users.

***

Once you have followed the necessary steps, you may be cleared to repost your thread and interact with the community as a representative of your business. Please let us know if you have any questions.
