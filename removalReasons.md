**No Business Post Approved**

Hi there, and welcome to the subreddit!

This message is to let you know that we have removed your recent thread due to being in violation of the [Rules and Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/rules), specifically this section:

****

## **Business Rules & Guidelines**


Businesses have special rules here.

1. Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) and ask for business flair. **You may NOT make any business-related posts without it.** The flair is a description that is displayed next to your username and verifies you are representing the company. It also encourages transparency. ANY business or representatives serving and promoting a business's interests are REQUIRED to have business flair.

2. After you have business flair, all business-related posts (this includes market research) **MUST** be submitted to the moderators for review prior to posting. (e.g. "I opened my own store", "I am thinking of opening my own store", etc).

3. Any businesses (or representatives serving and promoting a business' interests) posing and posting as regular users without identifying themselves with a business flair may be considered deliberately attempting to mislead the community. Misleading the community will lead to post removals and may damage your brand. If we determine the business was misleading, AB will not be able to support your business and all posts related to your business will be moderated with removal, even if posted by other users.

***

Once you have followed the necessary steps, you may be cleared to repost your thread and interact with the community as a representative of your business. Please let us know if you have any questions.



**Not AB**

This post has been removed as it not related to Asian Beauty as per our community guidelines. Please read the [Rules and Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/rules) if you haven't done so already.

**1:10 Content Ratio**

This is a reminder that we do enforce the community standards on self-promotional content on /r/AsianBeauty and in particular that **10% or less of your posting and conversation should link to your own content.**

We have noticed that your activity in general on /r/AsianBeauty is very limited in this regard. We love to see your content on the sub but we do need to see you also participating with the community in a higher volume in comparison to your recent activity on /r/AsianBeauty. If you have any questions feel free to reply to this message.

**No Comment on Haul post**

Hello! The message is to let you know that we have removed your post, and what you can do to get it back up. Your post requires a description comment, and according to the new rules without one we must remove the post.

Simply post a comment listing the products in your haul and we will be happy to approve the post. This is also a proper time to disclose any affiliations that may or may not exist.
