##The AB Routine: A Multi-Step Process

To reiterate what was first said in chapter 1, the AB routine consists of a multi-step procedure where each step consists of a product that is aimed at targeting your specific skincare needs. The easiest way to start your first AB routine is to focus on **five, and only five**, products:

* First Cleanser
* Second Cleanser
* Hydrating Toner
* Moisturizer
* Sunscreen

The reason why we only start with these five is that it is easy to get confused and overwhelmed when trying to obtain a variety of serums, essences, gels, lotions, masks etc. Remember to introduce each step one at a time for at least a week so that if you get a bad reaction you’ll know what caused it. We recommended **one new product every 4-6 weeks** but longer never hurt.

###First Cleanser
 
The first cleanser that you use on your face is aimed at removing the oil-based products from your last routine. Moisturizers, sunscreen and makeup all contain fatty acids which are not water-soluble and therefore require an oil-based cleanser to remove. If you are familiar with basic chemistry, you will have heard of a term known as “like dissolves like”. Water, H2O, is a polar compound which means that it has both a positive charge and negative charge and therefore it binds to other polar compounds (e.g. salts, alcohols). On the other hand, oil is non-polar, it is made up of a long carbon chain with many hydrogen atoms attached to it and is negatively charged. 

You may have heard of the oil cleansing method (OCM), which typically utilizes botanical oil (olive, coconut, jojoba etc.) or mineral oil as a cleanser. **Oil cleansers are something entirely different.** A manufactured oil cleanser contains both a base oil (often mineral, olive or coconut) as well as an emulsifying (emulsify: to mix water and oil) surfactant such as polysorbate 20. This mixture allows the oil base to remove oil from your skin, and the emulsifier allows water to mix into the solution so you can wash it all away afterwards. However, some residue tends to remain and this is why we use a second cleanser.

First cleanser types include:

* Micellar water (good alternative if traditional oil cleansers are too stripping)
* Cream
* Milk
* Balm  
* Stick (hard balm)

**TL;DR if you need to remove excess oil from your last routine or have issues with oily skin, use a first cleanser. Again, YMMV, and you may not absolutely require an oil cleanser.**

###Second Cleanser

The second cleanser is a water-based formulation that is intended to remove any remaining residue and help maintain your skin health. Because the second cleanser is water based, this means it has a pH specific to it. You will likely hear the importance of pH in water-based cleansers, and this is actually a very complicated matter but you can find more in-depth information available at the AB University. 

In short, pH refers to the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Pure water has a pH of 7 and is called "neutral". Anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above 7 is basic. Our skin can vary in pH from anywhere between 4-7, but [4.7 is typically thought of as being average, and it is important to keep it around this level in order to maintain optimal skin health.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489300) This is why most AB second cleansers are formulated with a pH close to that of skin, as a high pH can not only disrupt the [acid mantle of the skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_mantle), it can ultimately lead to less-than optimal skin flora, which often leads to breakouts and irritation.

Second cleansers types include:

* Foaming 
* Gel

YMMV: Not everybody requires a second cleanser, and different people will vary drastically in their second cleanser preferences.

###Hydrating Toner

When you hear the word "toner", you may think of the majority of Western toners which typically contain high levels of alcohol and are meant to be astringent, but end up being quite drying. AB toners are essentially the opposite - they are meant to a) preserve your acid mantle, b) draw water into and around your skin and c) prepare your skin for absorbing subsequent layers. The way hydrating toners do this is by being formulated with **humectants**, the most common one being hyaluronic acid. A humectant is a compound that is hygroscopic, meaning that it attracts and retains water. Most AB toners also have other fun and beneficial ingredients added in such as plant extracts and propolis. Interestingly, toners are often called "lotion" in AB nomenclature, so if you see the word lotion, it is likely referring to a hydrating toner.

###Moisturizers

There are a variety of moisturizers available, however their formulations are all very similar. They contain both water and oil that have been emulsified, which allows them to provide hydration and seal it in. A toner is on the far extreme of watery products, whereas an occlusive is on the far extreme of oily products, and moisturizers are somewhere in the middle. How heavy or light a moisturizer is depends on how you would layer it, **remember to layer moisturizers, and products in general, from lightest to heaviest.**

Moisturizer types include:

* Emulsions (light, watery)
* Creams (typical moisturizer)
* Some sleeping packs (heavy moisturizer)

---
###Sunscreen

If you are going to try to fall in love with any AB product, it should be sunscreen. Sunscreen is by far the most important step in your routine if you are going to be spending any time outside. UV light is the biggest cause of aging and skin cancer and can make PIH worse. Wearing sunscreen is extra important if you are using actives or exfoliating in any manner because exfoliation makes your skin slightly thinner, which allows more UV light to penetrate.

### More Advanced Steps


####Serum, Essence and Ampoule

Serums, essences and ampoules are actually quite similar in nature in that they are light and watery (but thicker than toners), and are meant to deliver specific ingredients at a higher concentration than moisturizers. Essences are the lightest of the three and are meant to go immediately after a toner. Essences often have ferments in them and are useful for brightening and hydrating. Serums often contain a few targeted ingredients such as niacinamide, plant extracts, propolis etc. and can vary widely in their thickness and ingredient profile. Ampoules are highly concentrated essences/serums and can be used as a spot or area treatment due to their potency. Depending on the ampoule, it can go either before your serums and essences, or after.

With how much skincare product competition and development there is, the lines have become blurred between what constitutes a serum, essence or ampoule. That being said, the best way to figure out which one you need is to focus on ingredients. You may only need one type, but you may find optimal results with two or more either all at once or in rotation depending on what your skin needs and when. 

####Gel
Gels are thicker than serums, essences and ampoules, are watery, and often contain a relatively dilute amount of targeted ingredient. Their main purpose is to provide light moisture, and because many gels contain aloe or snail, they are often very soothing and good for redness and/or irritation. 
####Masks
#####Sheet Masks
Sheet masks really aren't an advanced step - everyone can try them out! However, it is best to use sheet masks once you have a good grasp of what your skin reacts to so that you can avoid sheet masks with ingredients that don't agree with you. Sheet masking is a method of delivering an essence to your skin in an extremely effective manner - lots of moisture and beneficial ingredients in contact with your skin for a prolonged period of time. It is recommended that you only wear a sheet mask for 10-30 minutes, as anything longer will just lead to a dried out piece of cotton stuck to your face, which can cause some damage. However, silicone face covers can extend the time of wear, if you feel you need this. 
#####Wash-off masks

####Sleeping packs and occlusives
#### Actives
#####Acids
######AHA
######BHA
######Vitamin C
#####Retinoids

##Your Mileage May Vary

You will see this mantra repeated everywhere throughout this community. Why? Because we truly believe that the best way to manage your skin conditions is to understand yourself and your needs. What works for u/tag_bitch and u/printf-username, might be a colossal fail for u/ronrinesu. Conversely there may be a product that is a HG for u/petioignon that is meh and not worth the hype for u/thecakepie.  As a community, we can’t provide a sure fire list of products that will work perfectly for you.  /u/SnowWhiteandthePear shared her thoughts on why it’s really not feasible for us to recommend products for you^[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/383v1d/blogger_boundaries_why_we_cant_recommend_a/?st=j224e3m7&sh=f5586695), because it really depends on all of the above factors.

One of the best ways to decide which products to buy is by trying out samples. Resources over on r/AsianBeautyExchange are extremely helpful in this regard. Many of the community members there provide trial size and verified product samples which are helpful before making full-size product purchases.

In a discussion post on Core Four (Five) routine products from April 2017, u/redpen27 [said it best:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63minc/question_to_both_seasoned_abers_and_newbies_what/dfvogje/)

> “ [F]or real bought 40 decants and maybe 5 full-size products when i first started researching, then "slowed down" to maybe 1 full-size and a couple of decants a month after that... and my stable routine has MAYBE 7 products in it. (that said, i have like, 8 things to [full face, who am i kidding] test in the next few months so...hope springs eternal!) all i can say is: god bless abexchange or i would have spent so much more money learning what ingredients are good/bad for my skin.”
