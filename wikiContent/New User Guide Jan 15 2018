##**Chapter 1: Basic information about this subreddit (start here if new)**

---

##**Introduction** 

You may have found yourself in this subreddit as a result of taking an interest in skincare, hearing about “K-beauty” or perhaps you were referred from another subreddit or internet forum. Regardless of how you found out about us, our aim is simple – help you achieve your skincare goals while having fun, learn a bit about skincare science and become part of a great community. We understand that the amount of information available can be overwhelming so we’ve broken down our Wiki into various sections, starting with the most basic concepts and moving into more advanced topics in later chapters. Remember, we are not doctors and if you have concerns that merit a visit to a hospital, dermatologist or GP, you should get yourself to a professional ASAP. We’ll get started with the Asian Beauty concept and philosophy.

##**1.1 What is AB?**

Asian Beauty, abbreviated as AB, is the use of a multiple-step routine that incorporates products that each serve an individual purpose. Over two years ago, u/Sharkus_Reincarnus aptly put:

> “You know all those toners and essences and serums and ampoules and emulsions you keep hearing about? They act as a vehicle of delivery for different active ingredients to target different issues or to reinforce the treatment of issues. You might have a toner or essence that brightens, with a serum that targets aging, and an emulsion and cream that address redness. The possibilities are endless. That's what makes Asian skincare so effective for so many of us!”.

Another great philosophy that AB utilizes is using a routine that is gentle and nourishing so that your skin can fight for itself, rather than fighting your skin with harsh ingredients and products. 

##**1.2 The Golden rules of AB**

###1.2.1. Know your skin
Understanding what works for you and making informed purchases are a bit of a chicken-and-egg conundrum seeing as you won’t know your skin until you start using a routine, and you won’t know what to purchase until you know your skin! That being said, there are a lot of products out there that work for the majority of people and may be safe initial purchases, based on your skin type and skin concerns, which will be discussed in chapter 2. There may be a perfect product out there for you, but it may take some time to find it as you will have to figure out what specific ingredients your skin likes, which ones it can’t deal with and which ones are just meh. Even the most veteran ABers are usually still on the hunt for a holy grail (HG) for a specific step in their routine. 

###1.2.2. Haul responsibly
Everyone is excited to purchase their first AB products as soon as they gain a basic understanding of what types of issues they need to address. That being said, it is not a good idea to make spontaneous, uneducated purchases that may not work for you, or worse yet, lead to even more skin issues. Not only is this a waste of money, it can be potentially disastrous. Your first haul should only include four items that are discussed in chapter 4. After you are comfortable with your first haul and beginner routine, you can start adding in more products with targeted ingredients. However, make sure that you do your research on the purpose of the products you have your eye on as it is easy to grab two products in different categories that are redundant in their effects due to highly similar ingredients. [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/) is a great database for product ingredients, their purpose and their potential as an irritant. 

###1.2.3. Test and learn, your mileage may vary (YMMV)
There is no “one size fits all” routine in Asian Beauty or skincare in general. We can't say that The Reddit Asian Beauty RoutineTM exists. Your mileage may vary because everybody’s skin is slightly different. You will see this mantra repeated everywhere throughout this community. Why? Because we truly believe that the best way to manage your skin conditions is to understand yourself and your needs. What works for u/tag_bitch and u/printf-username , might be a colossal fail for u/ronrinesu . Conversely there may be a product that is a HG for u/petioignon that is meh and not worth the hype for u/thecakepie . As a community, we can’t provide a sure fire list of products that will work perfectly for you. /u/SnowWhiteandthePear shared her thoughts on why it’s really not feasible for us to recommend products for you3, because it really depends on all of the above factors.

One of the best ways to decide which products to buy is by trying out samples. Resources over on r/AsianBeautyExchange are extremely helpful in this regard. Many of the community members there provide trial size and verified product samples which are helpful before making full-size product purchases.
In a discussion post on Core Four (Five) routine products from April 2017, u/redpen27 said it best:

> “[F]or real bought 40 decants and maybe 5 full-size products when i first started researching, then "slowed down" to maybe 1 full-size and a couple of decants a month after that... and my stable routine has MAYBE 7 products in it. (that said, i have like, 8 things to [full face, who am i kidding] test in the next few months so...hope springs eternal!) all i can say is: god bless abexchange or i would have spent so much more money learning what ingredients are good/bad for my skin.”

##**Closing comments**
By now you hopefully have a bit of an understanding as to why we choose a gentle yet effective routine that is well-researched by the individual and requires a fair amount of trial and error. This is the foundation of the AB routine. If you ever find yourself getting swept up in consumer culture or stressing about trying to get the next hot new item, remember that this is a constant journey and what works for you, is in your budget and makes you happy is all that truly matters.

##**Chapter 2: Skin type**


##Introduction

The first step in getting involved in skincare is knowing your skin type, so that you can gain more understanding of why certain products will work better than others for you, specifically. While your skin is genetically predisposed to have traits that fall into one of the categories below, you may find that you have individual quirks that do not exactly fit the descriptions. That’s completely fine; this is meant as a starting point for you to identify your skin type first, followed by identifying your skin concerns/problems in chapter 3. 

###2.1 Normal
If you find your skin is not prone to being oily or dry, you likely have what is known as “normal” skin. Normal skin is often associated with being "ideal", only because it appears to be the most healthy as the balance of oil and water is optimal, leading to reduced pores, fine lines and blemishes. If you have another skin type listed below, it is possible to achieve "normal" skin, or as close to it as possible for your individual requirements, with a solid routine. 

###2.2 Oily
Most people who have oily skin likely already know that this is the case. Your skin is probably shiny, feels “greasy” and probably gets clogged with acne, bumps and blackheads fairly easily. 

###2.3 Dry/dehydrated
u/kjj17 described in detail the difference between dehydrated skin and dry skin in a January 2017 thread, excerpted here: skin that is dehydrated (lacks water) feels tight and can often be overly-sensitive, red, and may over-produce oil to compensate. Skin that is dry (lacks oil) may be rough and flaky. A lot of people who think they have dry skin are actually just dehydrated.

###2.4 Combination
Individuals with combination skin typically have a mix of oily and dry/dehydrated types. 	
The “T-Zone”, that being the forehead, nose and chin, are usually oily while the cheeks tend to be dry and/or dehydrated. 

###2.5 The Fitzpatrick Scale
This was picked up by r/skincareaddiction to help users find common ground on product use and efficacy, and it is definitely worth re-mentioning here. Skin colour (controlled by melanin) is the main identifying feature, and it demonstrates that the amount of melanin you have in your skin affects your response to UV light. [We typically use MAC shades for describing colour and tone here](https://imgur.com/a/qw8Jq), but if you want to use [this scale to assist in describing your skin type to other users, please feel free.]( https://imgur.com/a/PiZJ0) 

## Closing comments

Hopefully we have presented enough information here to allow you to identify your base skin type, which should help you narrow down your product choices and also fill in one part of your user flair, if you choose to make one. It is also important to remember that your skin type can change at different parts of your life depending on various factors like your environment, your hormones, your diet and even your routine. You may find that your skin type does not truly fit into one of these categories, and that's totally fine, this is only meant as a starting point so you can use specific vocabulary to help describe your skin to other people, and to keep track of it yourself.

##Chapter 3: Skin Concerns

Introduction: Now that you are more familiar with what type of skin you have, you can now start to identify the specific issues that your skin is having. Just because you have a certain skin type doesn’t mean that you will have certain issues, however there are often correlations between the two. For instance, oily skin is usually associated with acne and dehydrated skin is usually associated with dullness. Listed under each concern is a list of several treatments that have worked for the majority of people. While it is titled as "best treatments", remember that they may not necessarily be the best treatment for **you**, but they are a great starting point due to their general reliability at treating that particular concern. 

###3.1 Acne
Most of us are unfortunately very familiar with acne. It typically first appears during puberty when hormonal changes are taking place, leading to altered sebum production [(Imperato-McGuinley et al., 1993)](https://watermark.silverchair.com/jcem0524.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAb8wggG7BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGsMIIBqAIBADCCAaEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMuRzduwi4RSVg4mJ9AgEQgIIBcmJW8tkUGN8jYlZYwT1vWlPvnbcXSKZqiBdRoZLaiqza-4O_BtZ3oHl5JweNEf-xNxUgh-eYNlTloAYKBsSCBVV8ExeGe3nugKFppjw7qchCVCnR4s5XDcxLiXcFpKnfjwgX9fSdhc9-vx_WzIW2yiLlU1EI1zhwzpyJbO8fwVBFk3ruYZaHxkQu09p9Vx16dBHZ-x91EubWwLAtKT8O1Bgejz-2fUEICaAjh7C7PmrTh5AAkScMpV5GaUPUGXp2C6jEuf9z-GPbTVScG80hcqiHQH-oVxZNVF39tQYvLN3ZH-T4C8TSeXekoGawq_h6if1K_ed63XP2JHkoDysBktcDcCiV0JX_nj87Nzbhlbh3vv8BARQPwQkfAnJfPZfAIuSNz2EODIYZ3Icv2xEJ8W7HyCY1c282BkouEkXxBgymoYabtUJGpayrtdw-_RnbVXgWqUu2kwNJH7UbbisXEXRd5fKva7TZkb3Jy1REE7kZY6U). In short, the root cause of any pimple is essentially the same - the clogging of a hair follicle (pore) with dead skin cells, sebum and potentially some external factors ("dirt", generally), leading to a minor infection of the surrounding area. An infection is an overpopulation of microbial growth, which triggers your immune system to respond with white blood cells, which creates the pus that you see in the middle of the infection. This is why a lot of Western products and media take a scorched Earth approach to getting rid of acne. However, if you can address the root cause and simultaneously maintain healthy skin, you can fight acne without causing further damage.


####3.1.1 Bacterial acne
Your typical acne that is caused by the *Propionibacterium acnes* bacteria which feeds off of lipids, i.e. naturally produced oil. This is why many people who have oily skin are also quite acne prone. You need to have a healthy acid mantle and moisture barrier in order to fight off acne, and incorporating products that help increase the rate of dead skin shedding will also help tremendously. 

Best treatments: AHA, retinoids, hydration, some oils

####3.1.2 Fungal acne
Fungal acne is caused by the same underlying mechanism of microbial overgrowth, however in this case it is caused by an overgrowth of yeast cells. Read more in-depth about this at the AB University.

Best treatments: zinc, aloe, sulfur
	
###3.2 Pores
####3.2.1. Closed comedones
Closed comedones or CCs appear as skin-coloured bumps and tend to be very stubborn in terms of their removal. They are basically a type of acne that is not infected. If left untreated, they may develop into a pimple. Gentle exfoliation and maintaining a healthy barrier are key to removing CCs and preventing infection of the plugged pores. 

Best treatments: AHA, retinoids

####3.2.2. Open comedones (blackheads) 
This is a CC that has had the skin covering it removed, and becomes black as a result of the sebum oxidizing from the environment. The plug of dead skin and oil is still contained within the follicle. Facial extractions are a method of removing OCs, but can potentially cause damage. The gentle way to remove these requires quite a bit of patience. Exfoliation with a BHA will help uncover more of the plug, and oil cleansing will help wash away the plugs. 

Best treatments: BHA, oil cleansing

####3.2.3 Large pores
Unfortunately, large pores are mainly a product of genetics, but with a proper routine it is possible to reduce their appearance and prevent them from becoming larger. Ensuring your pores are kept well-cleaned, reducing oiliness and preventing build-up of sebum and dead skin cells well aid in making your skin appear smoother. It is also a myth that warm or cold water can open or close pores. There is a common misconception that warm water "opens" pores - if anything, warm water would make the skin around a pore slightly expanded, which would actually reduce the area of the pore open to the environment. Lukewarm water i.e. ~body temperature is best for washing in general as drastic temperature changes tend to alter the function of proteins.  

Best treatments: oil cleansing, clay masks, gentle exfoliation



###3.3 PIH
Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a darkening of the skin in the area of a previous trauma such as a cut or a pimple. PIH is mainly prevalent in people with naturally darker skin, as hyperpigmentation is a result of increased melanin production [Se et al., 2006]( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14764170600620668). Some examples of PIH here: [Fair skin]( https://i.imgur.com/5Y6UHXu.jpg)  [Medium skin]( https://i.imgur.com/rLZNk5z.jpg) and [Dark skin]( https://i.imgur.com/0VdHRl3.jpg)

Best treatments: niacinamide, vitamin C, licorice root

###3.4 PIE
Post-inflammatory erythema is redness of an area or spot caused by some kind of damage to the skin. It typically occurs immediately after active acne, and before PIH. Some examples of PIE [here](https://i.imgur.com/ArmnIcO.jpg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/LJg0yIC.jpg). Bear in mind that sunburn is also a type of PIE, as are other areas of redness caused by damage to the skin such as friction burns or puncture wounds. 

Best treatments: 

###3.5 Rosacea
Rosacea is a chronic condition that affects most areas of the face and can occur in varying degrees of severity from simple redness all the way to papules and lesions. It is more common with fair-skinned people, but can occur in darker skin and usually begins after age 30. Because rosacea can present in such varying degree, The National Rosacea Society has classified it in a [table from 2002 here](https://i.imgur.com/FnqXpDR.png). Be wary if you find yourself getting flushed very easily as this can be the first indication of rosacea.

Best treatments: 

###3.6 Aging
Aging skin is caused by deterioration of the skin tissue at various levels. Fat loss, connective tissue breakdown and lack of hydration are the main contributing factors involved in wrinkle formation and general sagginess. While aging is unavoidable and severe aging is mostly irreversible, prevention of wrinkles and sagginess with a regular routine including actives and sunscreen is the most effective method.

Best treatments: retinoids, vitamin C, AHA, sunscreen

###3.8 Texture
Texture is a bit of an interesting concern because it can be caused by some or all of the factors listed above. Typically people will say something along the lines of "I don't like the way my skin looks/feels, but I don't really have any obvious issues" when they have a texture-related skin concern. The key for addressing texture is pinpointing the small problems that can occur in different areas of the face, or all over. For instance, maybe you have dry/rough cheeks and fine lines developing on your forehead. In this case, you could area treat: gentle exfoliation and lots of moisturizer on your cheeks; retinol on your forehead.

###Asking For Help

Due to the volume of content and resources within AB, it can be really daunting for new folks entering into the world of Asian skincare! Back in December 2016, u/foir created a comprehensive resource on [how to ask for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5hrn3r/the_ab_guide_on_how_to_ask_for_help/) in r/AsianBeauty. Essentially it provides The core tenants of their post asked the following questions:

**Can this be answered in the Daily Help Thread?**

Our posting guidelines provide significant context to the [philosophy of the Daily Help Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/postguidelines#wiki_daily_help_thread_.28dht.29) which includes the types of questions that should be posted there: 

* Questions that are specific to your needs or are not provoking discussion
* Simple skin concerns
* A question you expect has been answered on AB before many times
* A BB/CC/Cushion recommendation request
* Simple questions about fakes
* Simple questions about popular ingredients
* Simple/Beginner routine help (including routine order, skipping steps, etc) 
* Questions about troubleshooting
* Questions about breakouts
* Specific questions about common products ( including favorite brands for masks/sleeping packs/eyeliner etc)
* If you think a question might have been asked on AB many times before, it should be posted in the DHT.


**Is this something I can figure out by researching on the sidebar or using the Search Function within Reddit?**

Many basic routine help information, product reviews, how to solve [acne, PIH/PIE, dryness] common issue can be found via the sidebar. There are quarterly routine megathreads, [Best/Worst Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6vpe41/discussion_bestworst_series_round_up_and/) (hosted by u/Maplebee92), and user reviews.

**Does my question expire? Is it a Frequently Asked Question?**

Questions on how to travel with AB routines, going to the gym and AB, as well as several of the above Search Function questions are typical FAQs. Some of them need to be refreshed every few months, whilst others likely don’t really change.

**Would providing more information yield better responses?**

Sometimes less is more, but with AB providing background, hypotheses and posing questions to the community are excellent ways to generate thoughtful(and helpful!) discussions
