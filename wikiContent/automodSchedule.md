        Hello and welcome to the Daily Help Thread! The purpose of the DHT is to ask simple questions, troubleshoot routines, get quick recommendations, prevent the sub from being too cluttered, and to guide new users.

        #Getting Started

        Please make sure to check out our new [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/index) and [AB University](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/education)!

        Remember to search the subreddit first to see if your question has been answered already. Tutorial [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/67bgjh/psa_how_to_properly_search_this_or_any_sub/?st=j1xueocy&sh=14303867).

        **Where applicable, consider sharing with us the following so we can help you better (*click "Source" below this post if you'd like to copy the formatting*)**

        * **Skin Type**:  | **Country/Climate I'm in**:  | **Top Skin Concern**:
        * **Current Routine/Products I'm Using**:
        
        **AM**
        * [product]
        * [product]
        * [product]
        
        **PM**
        * [product]
        * [product]
        * [product]

        **I specifically [want help with/am looking for a product to/am curious about trying]**...

        #Rules:

        If questions or comments break the rules or are inappropriate, the report button is the fastest way for the mod team to see it and address the problems.  For example:

        * Build Me A Routine, r/AsianBeauty! If you need assistance with your routine and need help with adding a product or two or understanding routine order, that’s fine. Please refrain from just stating a skin concern then expecting people to build a routine from scratch.  It is important to do due diligence in understanding your skin type and needs.

        * Non-AB questions or comments. Having non-AB products in your routine is totally fine! Getting specific advice/recommendations on a non-AB product not so much

        * Rude comments and snark. Fairly self explanatory but for more detail, check out our [Posting Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/postguidelines)

        * When directing someone to the sidebar: provide specific links. I.e. for someone asking about Allergies or Beginner Guides, link them to the specific subsections within AB University, rather than saying ‘it’s in the sidebar.’

        * Finally, a reminder that no one is obligated to answer your questions. If you've repeatedly asked the same question without a response, it may be best to review and see if it can be reworded or if the information is readily available in the sidebar materials. If you have any questions, please contact the [moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AsianBeauty).


        **Remember that all skincare is individual and Your Mileage May Vary with recommendations. We are enthusiasts, not doctors, and we cannot provide you with medical advice. Speak to a medical professional if your skin concerns are affecting your well-being.**

     Hey everyone! This is your quarterly routine megathread (as started by the ever-lovely /u/MissPicklesMeow, who has generously provided us the code). This is an excellent resource to see what products are popular amongst our community and a great way to find new things to try. No matter how unusual you may consider your skin type or atypical your particular skin challenges or problems, all routines are welcome -- in fact, *encouraged* -- to be posted.

     Acronyms you will most definitely see in use here: HG (Holy Grails), RP (Will Repurchase, AKA: liked it, will buy again, not an HG), WNR (Will not Repurchase, AKA: using up the last of it but not recommended). Understand them, use them, and love them &hearts;

     This post is intended to be a compendium of generalized, standardized routines! The more participation, the better. :)

     **To keep it easy for people to find their ‘skin twins’ we would ask that you use the following template.**

     **You only need to fill in steps that you actually use** (so if you don’t use an Essence, *remove that line*) and please **only provide up to three examples** of HG/recommended products for that step (so if you have 3 toners you love, you can list all 3!) 

     ***

     **Template**

     To make a single-spaced list, **add two spaces at the end of each line.** Alternatively, click 'source' at the bottom of the post to snag our code & format!

     **Skin profile:**  Mac Shade | Skin Troubles | Skin Type  (Note: unlike flairs, you can list as many troubles/types as you need!)

     **Season & Type of Climate:**

     **1st Cleanser:**

     **2nd Cleanser:**

     **pH Adjusting Toner:**

     **Vitamin C Serum:** 

     **BHA:**

     **AHA:**

     **First Essence:**

     **Hydrating Toner:**

     **Essence:**

     **Serum:**

     **Ampoule:**

     **Light Moisturizer:**

     **Medium Moisturizer:**

     **Heavy Moisturizer:**

     **Eye Cream:**

     **Facial Oil:**

     **Sleeping Pack:**

     **Mask Pack:** 

     **Sheet Mask:**

     **Sunscreen:**

     **Spot Treatment:**
