## Self-Promotion
**From the reddit wiki/selfpromotion:**

*"It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not okay to be a website with a Reddit account."* - Abe Lincoln

**How do I know if I must follow self-promotion rules?**

Self-promotion is posting links to, or comments about your own projects, research, blog, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. If the project is a profit-motivated business or market research, please see our [business rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/businessrules) and make sure that you're following all of the guidelines regarding spam. If your content or questions (especially anything that looks like market research) are NOT for profit, you should should state that in the post or it may be mistaken for breaking the business rules and removed.

If you're thinking of doing any self-promotion on Reddit, you might want to read this first.

If you're still unsure whether your content would constitute self-promotion, [message the mods here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty)

**Other subs remove my posts, what gives?**

In most parts of Reddit, self-promotion is generally frowned upon, and often outright forbidden. Here on AB we have special rules for self-promotion because we believe quality content can be posted this way. The reason we do this while other subs don't is because bloggers, YouTubers, and others **earn and maintain the trust of the sub.**  To participate here honor the folks before you that developed that trust. If you can't continue their work, this may not be the right place for your promotion.

These rules and guidelines are the same whether you run a major publication or brand, or if you have a personal blog or project.

##Rules:

1. You must already have 20 comment Karma on /r/AsianBeauty before your self-promotion is allowed.
2. You must adhere to our 1:10 ratio or your self-promotion content will be removed.
3. ALL external links including Imgur, Facebook pages, Instagram, YouTube, blog posts, Twitter etc. must contain a comment describing the content of the link. The comment must be posted immediately (within 15 minutes). Comments that fail to adequately describe content will result in your link from being removed.
4. You may only post self promotion content 2x a week. This includes self-posts or comments linking to your content. This limit is true even if you meet all other requirements.


Do keep in mind #7 of the General Rules and Guidelines:

* Affiliated Links or Referral Links must be fully disclosed within the title of an external link, or if a text post, fully disclosed in the original post.

**Guidelines:**

* It is better if you're new to first post comments, images, or links not related to your own content. Posting your own content first can cause friction and you may be mistaken for spam. This will seriously damage your brand. We want to support content from our community, so you should be a participating and contributing community member here, or we cannot support you.

* 1:10 ratio: Aim for 10% or less linking to your own content. That means 90% must be non self-promoting comments and links. Understand that commenting in reply to your own content does not count toward your 90%.

* Talk to people who comment on your content. Write comments outside your content. Participation is key to being a good member of the community.

* You should not upvote only things from your domain or project, or have any other employees or fans do the same. Every redditor should evaluate each comment based on the value when they read it.

* You should check your domain page from time to time - it is located at www.reddit.com/domain/<yourdomainhere.com> - check out what people are saying, what stuff of yours people like, and participate in the comments if people have questions or comments about something you've done. Identify yourself and be transparent: "Hi, I'm the author of this article, and I can answer the question you have about that..."

* For further reading on the guidelines we use, please read the **[Self-promotion on Reddit Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).**

##How to get Blogger/Creator Flair

For the mods to add a custom blogger/creator flair for you, we need some "proof", just to make sure you are the property owner. You can add a sentence like "I am also on Reddit and /r/asianbeauty !" at the end of your latest blog post, or somewhere on your site or account. For those of you who are too shy to let others know that you are on Reddit then simply use "美容护肤" (beauty and skincare in Chinese) at the end of your blog post or somewhere on your account. Send the link to the mods, and once your flair is added, feel free to edit it out.

You can only have one type of flair, so if you already have skintype flair, your creator flair will replace that.

Please note that **only blogs that are related to Asian Beauty will be granted flairs.** If your blog is about your general lifestyle and not culturally relevant content, then chances are you won't be getting a flair.
