#What should /r/asianbeauty do about businesses?

Typically, most beauty subreddits do not permit any businesses to participate. We believe that businesses CAN be contributors to the community, but because we also understand that a business's primary goal is to make money we find that some rules have helped us coexist. Our new policies make it simpler to understand how to interact as a business, and to help users understand why we have this unconventional policy at all. As some other subreddits have histories of exploitation of their subs for profit, we feel this concern is warranted.

Based on what we are hearing from the community, and what the mods have discussed, right now we are going to use the following parameters. (There may be some trial and error while we get it right, so consider these subject to change if they cause problems.)

We feel that these privileges and restrictions will allow businesses to contribute to the sub in ways that are unique to their roles without forcing anything unnatural. We think the sub will benefit from some of these but we also want to prevent overcommercializing the sub too, so we think allowing one post a month is a good system. If it becomes a problem we may restrict the posts further. As always, mods of AB do not accept gifts, or special deals, or anything actually.

##I'm representative/employee of a business, or I'm planning to start a business. What do I do first?

1. Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) and ask for Business Flair. **You may NOT make any business-related posts without it.** Flair is a description that is displayed next to your Reddit username when you make posts or comment on /r/asianbeauty (it will not show in other parts of Reddit, for example private messages, other subreddits). We use business flair to confirm you are representing the company. It also encourages transparency. ANY business or representatives serving and promoting a business's interests are REQUIRED to have Business Flair.

2. The mods will confirm you are the business you claim by requesting that you follow verification steps.

Once you and representatives of your company have flair, familiarize yourself with all of our business rules. Ask the mods if you have questions about a rule.

##Once you are verified with Business Flair:

1. After you have Business Flair, all promotional posts (this includes market research) **MUST** be submitted to the moderators for review prior to posting. We will remove promotional posts that do not comply, and we may revoke your permission to post for 30 days.

2. Any businesses (or representatives serving and promoting a business' interests) posing and posting as regular users without requesting to be identified with Business Flair **may be considered deliberately attempting to mislead the community**. Misleading the community will lead to post removals and may damage your brand. If we determine the business was misleading, AB will not be able to support your business and all posts related to your business will be moderated with removal, even if posted by other users.

3. Promotional content is limited to 1x a month. Please use the "Business" posting tag (post flair). [Here's a link to how to do this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/posttags)

4. Businesses can promote either by **AMA ("Ask Me Anything"), sub giveaway, or special offer** for the sub. Basically, your post will need to benefit the community in some way. If you have a creative idea, run it by us. Posts that do not benefit the community will not be allowed, and in such cases we recommend that businesses consider [buying Reddit's ads](http://www.reddit.com/advertising).

5. Businesses can request to host AMAs with the understanding that they are expected to be honest and not just promote their latest product, etc., and beforehand we may discuss with them about how Reddit AMAs may or may not be right for their business and encourage them to do some research. We want to run successful, helpful AMAs.

6. Promotion posts 1x a month can be combined in one post, for example: host a giveaway AND a discount code in one post.

##Promotional Business Communication:
* **Sub Giveaways:**
Businesses can host well-planned giveaways but no “sample” giveaways or low-value single product giveaways. Case by case basis for now. These will count for the 1x a month rule.

* **Special Offers:**
Businesses can offer discount codes to subscribers of /r/asianbeauty. These should be 15% off or better, or be free shipping offers. Case by case basis for now. These will count for the 1x a month rule.

* **AMAs:**
"Ask Me Anything" is a Reddit-specific phenomenon. Some consider this a keystone of Reddit's popularity! If you want to learn more about these you can read some past AMAs, google a bit, and you may ask the mods some questions about AMAs once you have done so.

* **Your Creative Idea:**
Pitch us your plan. Be mindful your idea will have to benefit to the community.

##Non-promotional Business Communication:

* Flaired businesses can **respond** when their company is directly discussed, such as shipping disputes, discontinuing products, brand complaints, ingredients questions, etc. These do not count toward your maximum posts as long as there is no promoting/soliciting.

* Flaired businesses can participate in the community. They can discuss topics, or help newbies with their routines, or anything like that. Business Flair acts like a disclosure, so users will know your responses may or may not be biased. Businesses exploiting this will be obvious over time and may lose such privileges.


**Examples for what businesses could respond to:**

**YES:**

A: “I think I got a fake Moozon smail gel”

B: “Yes it is a fake, I am a rep from Moozon and I confirm that”

**NO:**

A: “Hey everyone, recommend me a cleanser”

B: “Our newest AHA cleanser is top-of-the-line with new cat oil ingredients for whiter skin and wrinkle reduction”

##This sounds like a lot of work! I don't have the time to get to know Reddit and participate this way!

You might want to buy a sponsored headline or advertisement instead. You can buy these from Reddit (not us, we are volunteers) for as little as $5 and target subreddits that are relevant to your site or project. Click here for more information: http://www.reddit.com/advertising
