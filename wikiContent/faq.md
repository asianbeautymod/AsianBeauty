##What is double cleansing?

This is not referring to washing your face twice with the same product - as the name suggests - but rather, removing makeup and cleansing skin in two separate steps.  Typically in Asian skincare, removing makeup and sunscreen is called "*cleansing*" while cleansing the skin is called "*washing*".  Confusing, I know!  Products like cleansing oil are used as a first step and are meant to be followed (typically) by a foaming cleanser as a second step.  For further explanation and how-to, Snow White and Asian Pear has a great blog post on the subject [here](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.ca/2014/08/skincare-discovery-cleansing-part-i.html).
