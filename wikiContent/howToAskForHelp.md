#How To Post For Help

Before submitting a post looking for help please read the FAQs and Wiki.  The sidebar has a list of resources that may contain the answer to your question! Take a quick look through the first few pages for similar questions and use the search box.

When making a new post asking for help it is beneficial to include some basic information so we can help you more thoroughly.  Some information you may want to include is your skin type, current routine, products you currently use, ingredients you are allergic to or need to avoid, and what issues you're looking to target.  Additional information you may want to include for specific help is your age, climate, what country you're located it, and your budget.

**Before you post...**
---
We get a lot of new threads on AB that are questions:

* that can be answered in the daily thread
* that can be answered with a bit of research
* that would get much better responses with a bit more information provided
* that are asked frequently and usually get the same responses

In order to provide helpful answers to common questions, here are some suggestions on what to do/try *before* you ask for advice on AB. There are three parts to this guide:

1. **When and how to ask for help**: Certain questions are better suited for our daily help thread.
2. **Resources to answer your own frequently asked questions**: A bit of research will either solve the problem or provide more information.
3. **Frequently Asked Questions**: And their typical responses.

***

**The Daily Help Thread**
--

AB has regular [Daily Help Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/search?q=ASK+HERE%21+Daily+Help%2C+and+Questions%3A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) that covers your personal questions and is highly trafficked by new and old users alike.

###How do I tell if my question deserves a stand-alone thread or if it's better suited in the daily thread?

The general rule is if it is personal to you or can be answered with only one comment, it belongs in the daily thread. Questions for standalone threads are reserved for those that are generalized and **breed discussion** and multiple comments. From the [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4qdof8/automatic_post_flairing_and_daily_help_thread/):

* ####Should go in the daily help thread:

 * **Questions about your routine:**  *“Where does this AHA go in my routine?”*

 * **Questions on how to use a product:** *“Should I leave my sheet mask on for over 30 minutes?”*

 * **Product suggestions for user-specific problems:** *“How do I get rid of my CC’s? Here’s a picture/description.”*
 * **Asking if anyone has heard of a brand/product:** *“Has anyone heard of the brand SnailBees? Are they good?”*
 * **Asking for product recommendations:** *“I’m going to Japan in a month! What should I get?”*

 * **Questions with a simple answer:** *“Does my SnailBees cushion refill fit into any other cushion case?”*

* ####May have its own thread:

 * **Asking about good products for a problem in general:**  *“What is your best product for fighting hyperpigmentation?”*

 * **Discussions on brands and products**: *“What’s your favorite product from SnailBees?”*

 * **Topics that generate *discussion* among the community**

If you start a thread for a question that would be better suited in the daily help, this will most likely be pointed out to you by users and moderators alike and eventually removed. This is not meant to dissuade you from asking or to make you feel unwelcome, it's simply trying to direct you to where it is meant to go. Even if I know the answer to your question, I'm probably not going to answer it not as a personal slight to you but because I do not want to indulge individual threads or give anyone special treatment. I'll instead ask you to meet me in the Daily Help.


###This seems unwelcoming for new users though.

We promise it isn't meant to be, it's simply a way to organize our community and let you know how we field simple questions. If you take a look through the daily threads, you'll realize fairly quickly that:

1. **The sheer amount of questions that gets asked daily is immense.** Which is awesome, we love interacting and helping each other out as much as possible! But imagine if each and every question was a standalone thread, it would get pretty congested around here pretty quickly. We have found that if we keep it in one thread, we reach a balance between genuinely wanting to help you and not feeling strung out- and that the majority of users prefer this method. We ask that you try to understand and meet us in thread when asking for our help!

2. **The vast majority of questions get answered.** Those that are upvoted have been seen by users who do not know the answer but are hoping to drive attention to it. We all sort by new first, scroll to make sure everything has been answered, and then sort by top specifically to see any questions we may have missed that were trickier or required more responses. If your question is getting upvoted and doesn't yet have an answer, please be patient. If your question remains unanswered after a lengthy period of time, it might be that we just don't know.

3. **Our users are generally welcoming, friendly and are really going out of their way to try and help you.** We aren't contributing this time and effort because we need to, but because we love the community and the members and want to give back. Please respect and be kind towards our efforts and that we are simply enthusiasts trying our best to lend a hand.

###A lot of relevant information gets lost in the daily thread this way though. If they *were* stand alone threads, maybe I could find them in reddit search.

Yeah, reddit search is not great, I commiserate with you. You should be using reddit's search function, but don't depend on it as your sole source for researching because it only searches the title and body of self text posts. See below on how to use google as an aid in searching this subreddit.

###Sometimes I only get one comment but I would appreciate hearing more opinions.

A lot of the time, we are keeping an eye on the answers given so that if we really disagree or think more information is needed, we'll chime in. If you want to ensure that you get multiple answers, say so in your question. Make it bold by adding ** on each side, and add the note **Would like multiple opinions.** I promise I will upvote and make sure to add my 2 cents.

###What are some things I can include to make sure I get the answers I'm looking for?


Here are some things that can help us help you:

 * Probably the most basic, but as mentioned in the Daily Help thread, **include your skintype, your routine, and your skin concerns** to the best of your abilities.

 * You may also want to **include how long you have had your routine in place, and how long you've been testing any new products.**

 * **What you have tried or looked at so far.** This can be telling for a lot of problems, especially if you are looking to refine a routine. Don't hesitate to overshare with us.

 * **Misc Factors:** Skincare is a gender neutral hobby, so oftentimes it isn't relevant to note your gender but if you feel it is pertinent to your question, please feel free to include it. Your **age range** is more likely to come into the equation, as skin may have different needs at different points of one's life. Similarly you may find that **budget, diet, skin tone,** may be useful to know depending on your question.

There are a lot of questions that are actually already answered in this sub, it's just hard to know where to look, especially if you are on mobile. For this reason I'm including a section of threads on and off the sidebar in this thread for easy access and navigation.

###A Quick Note on Google Search:

Reddit search is fine for looking up keywords in the title or the body of text posts, but that's about it. It will not pick up on *keywords in the comments*. For that, you have to use an off-site resource, like google.

A simple format in using google is by adding on the tag "site:reddit.com/r/asianbeauty" after your search term(s). This confines your google search to this subreddit, which will then include results from the comments!

I'm giving this trick its own special shoutout because it is always a good idea to google a question or product or keyword that you're curious about, in and out of this sub. I have found a ton of surprising and informative threads this way so no matter your question, consider this trick.

For more reading or tools regarding this tip, [[YSK] How to use Reddit's native search and Google search](https://np.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3smwwc/ysk_how_to_use_reddits_native_search_and_google/) is a handy callback, and the [English to Korean Skincare & Makeup Dictionary to Help You Google Better](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3x6thg/english_to_korean_skincare_makeup_dictionary_to/) and [Basic Katakana to Identify Japanese Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4bcknz/miniguide_basic_katakana_to_identify_japanese/) both can be of use when searching.

* Similarly, browse through the Product Guides linked above to see if there is already a thread that caters to what you are looking for.



### "Has anyone tried [x product]? Thoughts?"

* Use reddit search *and* google in this subreddit as described above to see if the product has been mentioned either as a standalone post *or* in the comments section of this subreddit.

* Get to know the [Has Anyone Tried...?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/search?q=Has+Anyone+Tried...%3F+Skincare+Product+Information%2C+Tips%2C+and+Tricks%21&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) series to see if there is either a mention in a past thread or an active thread to participate in. Similarly, the weekly [Rant, Raves, and Mini Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/search?q=rants+raves+and+mini+reviews&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) are always nice to keep an eye on. Check out the [User Submitted Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4pt03g/user_submitted_reviews_part_1_one_and/) series to browse or submit standalone  reddit reviews. And the [Blogger Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/bloggers) is a nice start to discover some great voices in the AB Blogosphere.


### "BHA/AHA/Vit C/Tret question, including purging and overexfoliation?"

* Check out the [AB Actives Intro Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4z7d8v/actives_an_ab_intro_guide_and_faq/) or the [Vitamin C Guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/vitaminc) to get to know actives and see if your question is answered there.

###"Something is breaking me out and I have no idea what, please help"

* You will be asked if you patch tested and spaced out your products. If you haven't, the suggestion you will receive is most likely: Start over and space out your products. This is an annoying answer, but a necessary one. It is extremely difficult to pinpoint culprits with so many factors in the equation since everyone's skin is different.

* If you have spaced out your products and have it narrowed down, the [CosDNA Comparison Tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3g34we/cosdna_comparison_tool/) and the [Excel Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/50sw4g/a_tutorial_in_using_excel_to_quicklyish/) is a fantastic resource in pinpointing what ingredients might be giving you trouble. It is not a fun process, but these tools will help.

### "I'm planning a shopping trip in [x] location, any recommendations on products or places!?"

* Make sure you've gone through the Shopping Guides linked above to check and see if there are any physical locations or tips already mentioned. These are as of this post outdated, so you'd also probably benefit from good ol' google.

### "Can you help me find a match for BB Cream?"

* Make sure to check out the Makeup Product Guides linked above, there is a How To Find the Right Base Makeup that along with the MAC Shade and Swatch Megathreads might prove useful to you!

* There are BB Sampler Sets that include samples of various BB Creams that might interest you. Similarly, check to see if any specific base makeup you're interested in has any available in sample form. Missha will send you samples for free if you send them the request through their website.
