#Welcome new ABers!

First and foremost, welcome to our wonderful AB wiki. We hope that you find what you need here before posting to avoid clutter and repetitive questions. However, please, do not hesitate to reach out to the community via the Daily Help Thread if you're unsure about anything. There's a fine line between personal questions and discussion questions! So, please use your better judgment for where your future questions should go. Remember, we are not doctors, if your skin says stop, stop. Any medical advice should be given to you by a doctor, not reddit. This has been wonderfully summarized in  ["Why we can't recommend a product for you"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/383v1d/blogger_boundaries_why_we_cant_recommend_a/?st=j224e3m7&sh=f5586695) by /u/SnowWhiteandthePear.

[Here](http://bit.ly/2pjqbnJ) is a wonderful compare and contrast guide written by /u/Sharkus_Reincarnus. In summary, it talks about the philosophy of Asian skincare and how it differs from western skincare. It's beautifully written and I'd like to preserve it as is. There is more information about all of the different products and types of products in the wiki so feel free to read up more!

[Do you have dehydrated or dry skin?](http://bit.ly/2q7EgVh) Oily skin produce to much oil, dry skin lacks oil, and dehydrated skin lacks water. Skin can be oily and dehydrated or dry and dehydrated. You have combination skin if your t-zone is oily, but other parts of the face feel dry. Dehydrated skin produces more oil than it supposed to, so you can easily confuse combination and dehydrated dry skin. Dehydrated skin often feels oily and flaky at the same time.

##Skincare Routines
1. Figure out what your skin type is. Spend some time to check your face. Remember, your face isn't just the chin and forehead, your face includes your forehead and nose too! Take care to note from the beginning of the day to the end of the day where the oily parts are or where you see some flakiness. Your skin may start to change once you start your routine so don't worry about getting this right the absolute first time!
2. What kind of skin concern do you have? Some people are worried about aging, others are concerned about acne scars on their face. What's yours?
3. First cleanser. It can be oil, balm, micellar water, or something new! Dont' be afraid to venture out and try new products. Who knows, maybe you'll find the new HOT thing!
4. Second cleanser. A gentle foaming cleanser or cream cleanser.
5. Hydrating toner. You've just stripped everything away from the skin, so prep your skin to soak up all of the goodies you're about to put on your skin with toner. There are many different toners out there. Some target those with acne, others are hydrating, and some balance out the pH. It's not unheard of to use multiple cleansers. Some people apply toner with a mist, others with fingers, and some with an applicator. Try them all! In Japan, sometimes toners are referred to as balancing water or lotion.
6. Serums/Emulsions/etc. As your routine gets more advanced. You may want to add in these wonderful things to BOOST your routine. They are not necessary when you're first starting out.
7. Moisturisers. These can vary between gels, gel creams, or creams. What kind you use will mostly depend on your skin type, weather conditions, and whether or not you'll be wearing make-up on top.
8. Daytime? Better wear sunblock. I think AB can all agree if you don't do ANYTHING else to your skin at least put on sunblock. It's a heavily discussed topic and has its own wiki page!

###What to buy for your first haul
Don't worry about buying everything at once. A lot of AB is experimenting what works well for you and your skin. Currently, the trend is to purchase four products and add on a few extras, like sheet masks! Slowly build up your routine and skincare collection. One pro to this is that if you end up with an allergic reaction, you can pinpoint which product caused it and possibly what ingredient. Remember to **ALWAYS** patch test!

There are a ton of ABer's constantly destashing over at /r/AsianBeautyExchange so maybe you can score some samples or full sized items for less than MSRP!
