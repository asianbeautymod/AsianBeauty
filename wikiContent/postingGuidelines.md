The guidelines are intended to help you to better understand posting here on AB. We hope that this document will be of help to both AB veterans and newcomers. We encourage participation from everyone!

---

##Stickied threads:
###A Note about stickies:
Because Reddit infrastructure is limited to two things stickied at once, we may UNSTICKY something to make room in certain cases. Most of our schedule will be consistent, but changes may occur temporarily as needed.
***

###Daily Help Thread (DHT)

**Philosophy**
Our Daily Help Thread was created to encourage posting for people new to AB and for those with simpler questions and concerns. It’s an "Anything Goes" arena where no question is a stupid question, but it’s best used for questions that still haven’t been answered by sidebar material or searching the sub/Wiki. This is not meant to be the only place on the subreddit where questions can be asked, but a place where everyone should feel free to ask any question they have, and in general a place for all the personal questions that you need answered but that the wider community might not be interested in discussing.

Posting something can take a lot of courage, and we'd like to maintain an environment where people feel safe doing so. If you are in the DHT with the intention of answering other people’s questions, we encourage you to scroll past the questions that do not interest you rather than discourage users from asking their questions.

We encourage you to ask questions in the DHT, but please understand that you might not get an answer every time - participation in DHT is completely voluntary, and the users responding to questions offer their assistance on their own free time and receive nothing in return, so please be mindful of that. Asking clear questions, including important information about your skin type, and clearly expressing the problem you want to solve will make your questions easier to read and answer. Be polite and concise, and thank the people who have helped you..

**Non-AB Products in the Daily Help Thread**

Questions mentioning non-AB products are fine, but if the question is primarily framed around non-AB items it may be removed.

**Should I post my question in the Daily Help Thread or on the Main AB page?**

In general, a rule of thumb is that questions that are specific to your needs or are not provoking discussion belong in the Daily Help Thread. Please search [link to sub search tutorial]() the subreddit before posting a discussion question. If you think a question might have been asked on AB many times before, it should be posted in the DHT. **When in doubt, always post in DHT first.**

**Post in the Daily Help Thread if you have:**

* Simple skin concerns
* A question you expect has been answered on AB before many times
* A BB/CC/Cushion recommendation request
* Simple questions about fakes
* Simple questions about popular ingredients
* Simple/Beginner routine help (including routine order, skipping steps, etc)
* Questions about troubleshooting
* Questions about breakouts
* Specific questions about common products ( including favorite brands for masks/sleeping packs/eyeliner etc)


**Post in the Main AB Page if you have:**

* Questions that haven’t been asked for 30 days (please make sure you search [link] the subreddit before posting)
* Questions and topics that generate discussion within the community, and are not personal questions in disguise. [include template of questions that inspire discussions + links]

#Regular (/r/AsianBeauty main) posts


###About Post Flair:

We consider flairs an important part of our sub functions. If you want to avoid or find specific kinds of posts, you can filter posts by flair from the sidebar. As the sub grows, more flairs may be added, or some may be changed.

###About Restricted Content:
Memes, Hauls, Gifs, Fluff, and Selfies are only allowed during their respective days and threads. Post flair for Mod Post and Businesses are restricted only to Mods and Business-Flaired Businesses.

###[Review]:
This counts all reviews, including photostories, text reviews, blogs, youtube, instagram, serious reviews, and mini reviews. All reviews that are sponsored, paid, or include review products that were provided for free must disclose that in either the title or the text of the post.

###[Question]:
A core feature of AB will always be the asking of questions, and the search for answers. That said, only certain questions belong on the main page of the sub. Questions on the main page are ones that are not specific to yourself, and are not frequently asked (exact question asked less than 30 days ago). If your question might be easy to answer, or has probably been asked many times before in the 4-year history of AB, or if you have any doubt it meets the questions standards, first post in in our Daily Help Thread. It has a ridiculously high response rate. If you're not sure, see our guidelines on "Should I post my question in the Daily Help Thread, or on the Main AB page?"

**[Discussion] or [Question]?**

If you are wondering if you should flair your post with question or discussion, here’s a guide that can help you. Questions are usually more narrow and don’t really engage with the whole community. Discussions usually ask for everyone’s opinion about a certain topic.

Examples:

[Question]: "What are toners worked well for dry skin?"

[Discussion]: "What is everyone’s favorite toner this year?"

###[Discussion]:
Sometimes, discussions are based on a question, or a topic, brand, or product type. Sometimes they are deep, sometimes they provide excellent crowdsourcing. Sometimes they are what we label a post we can't categorize elsewhere. Nonetheless, they can generate chat and will pull in all kinds of answers from all over the subreddit.

###[Swatches]:
Swatches are photos of color products that are taken on the skin or another surface to demonstrate their true nature. When writing your title, please include at least the brands you are swatching, and if possible, the type of makeup, and the product name. It makes the post more searchable.


###[Mod Posts]:
The mods occasionally need to communicate with the sub and use mod post tags to authenticate the post as being from moderators, while making the posts easier to find or filter out. The “Mod Post” flair is restricted.

###[Meetups]
Do you have a specific plan to meetup in real life or digitally? List your event! You can also remind people about an upcoming event (up to twice a week), search for locals who might be interested in hosting an event, or reminisce over past events (including photos, hauls, store reviews). We have a meetup link on the sidebar, so if you host a meetup please PM the mods with the details of your event. If you have a group on Facebook or Meetup, we can also include a link to that so others may easily find your group.

###[Discovery]
A new collection is coming out? Or you have recently found a newly launch brand you want to share with us? We’d love to hear about that.

###[Weekly Roundup]
You can find /r/AsianBeauty’s most discussed and loved posts for the week curated under this flair.

###[Journal]
If you want to share your skin progress and your current routine (that’s more than just a FOTD/selfie) document your journey here! Don’t forget to message the mods with a link to your post and we can include it on the [Journal](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/journal) section in the sidebar.


###[Business]
You may not post a business post without first having business flair, and mod approval. All business posts must be flaired. If you are a business and you want to submit any post, please read our [business rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/businessrules) first.

###Mod-only posts:

* Mod communication/announcements
* Scheduled threads (weekly, monthly, etc)
* Megathreads
* Meta-chats (if you have concerns or ideas outside of these threads, you can message the mods and propose topics for the next monthly meta-chat thread)


###Megathreads:
The mods regularly create and sticky Megathreads. These are posts that gather a lot of answers together, also known as crowdsourcing. The categories for Megathreads are listed below, and a posting schedule

**Routine**
Find your skin twins! See what other products people are using, and what order. Fantastic crowdsourcing info.

**Holy Grail**
In the beauty community, we say that something is a "Holy Grail" when it is essential for you. Share your most valued products and why they are great for you. It's helpful to list similar products you tried and why you prefer your HG instead.

**Holy Fail**
In contrast to “Holy Grail,” these are products that super did not work for you.

**Swatch Comparison**
Fantastic opportunity to swatch products and create a mini repertoire of data for others.

#Anything else I should consider?

##Relating to AB itself:
Asian beauty is just a tool. There will be parts of AB that are better for some people, and not others. We can all agree that we should avoid "AB is superior" tones, because this isn’t necessarily true. AB saved a lot of our skin, but many still use western products too. Products work because of formula, not origin. We should always choose what is best for us, and remember that can mean a diverse range of products and sources.

##Relating to Fashion and Beauty posts, Celebrity Photos,Inappropriate content:
We think more fashion/beauty posts would be great. For this to work, we must allow celeb photos, as celebrities heavily influence the fashion world as trendsetters. When you reduce a person to a race, or sexual desirability, we do not feel this is appropriate for this sub, and it's best if you can think of a deeper reason to express appreciation for their qualities. When celeb posts come up some will be okay and some won't. For example,

**Not Okay:**

"OMG Asians are so gorgeous", "Japan is beauty!", "Chinese women like Fan Bing Bing are so sexy just look at this", "Korean women never age", "Indian women are so pretty I can't even look at them."

**Better:**

"Fan Bing Bing's fashion is totally on point at the award show", "I love [this very famous drama] and [this very famous actress] has fantastic style in it", "I want to do my makeup like [this very famous model] in this particular photo"

##Relating to Western Products/Non-AB products:
Because our sub is focused on Asian Beauty, that is the core group of products we will be discussing and suggesting. However, western products are not prohibited from being included in this discussion! Many users have western products in their routine, whether they are new to AB or advanced routine masters. It’s good to use what works best for you, and above all else, that is the mantra we want to encourage when it comes to skincare. However, you should come in expecting to discuss AB products and realize that western product suggestions are not in the forefront. If you are looking specifically for a western product, it is  considered out of the scope of our subreddit or off-topic. Please use your good judgment (we trust you guys!) to decide when it’s appropriate to bring up western products and know that AB products are the primary focus of our community.

**Examples of when western products are not appropriate:**

* You ask a question such as “Which Aveeno Moisturizer should I buy”
* You want western product suggestions for your routine
* Your post a haul or FOTD with only western products
* You post a link to sales or coupons for western brands
* You post in detail about skin conditions and concerns that is primarily focused on dermatology or non AB products

##Relating to Skincare:
Similar to our rules about western products, talking about skincare is fine, but if your post is primarily focused on either of these topics with Asian Beauty as an adendum, it likely belongs on other subs.


## Relating to Downvoting:

Downvoting doesn't really solve anything, because if a post is violating the rules, it should be reported. If it isn't breaking the rules and you disagree with the content, consider articulating your view politely in a comment to encourage discussion, or just scroll past it. The downvote button is not a disagree button. You can also use the hide function to hide posts that you don't want to see.


## Sub Policing:

We like to keep the sub clean of spam, dishonest behavior, harassment, and uncivil behavior. If someone is breaking the rules, please report the post or comment. It is always helpful to include a reason for the report.

**”Try the Search Bar”:**

Before you ask a question, please search the subreddit to see if someone has already answered it in a past thread.

Even polite comments like "Have you done a search for the answer to your question?" could in some cases make someone feel stupid for asking, so it might be more tactful to look for other ways to answer, or scroll past. For example, you could do a search and post what you found in your search. You are under no obligation to help anyone. Do what you think is best.

If you think they are rude or didn’t put any effort in, just do not give them any attention. You don’t have to feel obligated to help everyone. THEY must learn to figure out how to get answers. It is the user’s responsibility to put some effort in to get the results they desire. There are many reasons someone might not use the search bar. Searching using Reddit is notoriously difficult, but it is also the user's responsibility to put some effort in to get the experiences they want. The bottom line, though, is you don't have to help everyone who asks. If don’t feel like helping, that is completely okay, and you should scroll past.

[How to search the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/67bgjh/psa_how_to_properly_search_this_or_any_sub/?st=j1xueocy&sh=14303867) by u/BlobsterBisque



**”Read the sidebar:”**

Our sidebar is very rich in resources, but it is not a replacement for discussion and input from our users. It is not an authority for skincare or AB products. If you want to help someone and know their answer is in one of the resources in the sidebar, you can mention the link and point them in the right direction! It is more helpful than referencing them to the sidebar in general, which can sometimes feel like a discouragement of conversation. Some mobile apps make the sidebar difficult to access. New users may also have trouble processing all the new information, since AB has quite the learning curve. It is never a problem to copy information from the sidebar in a comment, it is freely available for that purpose. Nobody is obligated to help if they do not want to do so!

##Kindness toward new users, kindness toward reddit "mistakes:"

Many people only joined Reddit so they can be on AB. We should be flattered! Reddit can be a tough place sometimes, unfortunately, and here at AB we do try to buck that trend. Because a lot of our users do not know all of the Reddit norms, they will make mistakes. We know it is tempting to punish them for it (especially when it looks malicious), but we please ask our users to resist the temptation.

**If you are new to AB:**

Please try your best to be patient while you learn Reddit. This place is awesome but takes some time to get familiar with the culture and rules. A great first post would be in our weekly help thread or random chat weekend, as those are more "anything goes" type of arenas. We always try to make AB a safe place to ask questions and to share your experiences, and the mods always welcome feedback related to that.

Try to be respectful, and thank those who help you.



##Fantastic content:

If you see something great, say so! Tell the person in a comment or pm. Upvote! This will encourage valuable contributions to the sub. Feel free to message the mods if you think a post would be a good candidate for our weekly roundup post on Sunday.

If you do not see content that you like, why not post some? Why wait for someone else to provide it? If you have been here a long time, and want good content you might consider being the influential person who posts it.

You don’t have to be an expert to post great content in the sub. Share your own experiences, try something out, talk about what you’ve learned. Even a new person can offer much. You never know what will help other people or what will strike a chord.
