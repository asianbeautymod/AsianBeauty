#Posting Guidelines

The guidelines are intended to help you to better understand posting here on AB. It should be noted that these are simply guidelines so that everyone can get the best out of their posts. Think of these guidelines as best practices. They are here to help you better understand the subreddit culture and posting here on our wonderful subreddit!

These are not rules; posts that do not exactly comply with these guidelines may still be approved if we feel they contribute to the subreddit. However, in the future, we may consider converting guidelines into rules if necessary.

We hope that these guidelines will help everyone, both new and old, understand posting here on AB and to help encourage participation from everyone.

##Stickied threads:

###The Daily Help Thread

**Philosophy**

Our Daily Help Thread was created to encourage posting for people new to AB and for those with simpler questions and concerns. It is an "Anything Goes" arena where no question is a stupid question. This is not meant to be a limit on where questions can be asked, but a place where everyone should feel free to ask any question they have.  Moreover, as of 5/26/2016 all Routine Help questions must go in the Daily Help Thread.

Posting something takes a lot of courage, and we'd like to maintain an environment where people feel safe doing so. Scrolling past a question that does not interest you is a practice we'd like to encourage, rather than discouraging users from asking their question. You can still ensure quality by rewarding good posters with responses and reporting rule breakers. We love positive reinforcement.

That said, if you are posting in our Daily Help Thread, understand that no one is obligated to help. They offer their assistance of time, energy, and goodwill. We are amazed by the quality of the support our newbies receive here. If you want to post in the Daily Help Thread, make it more likely that someone will help you or answer you by asking clear questions, including important information about your skin type, and clearly express the problem you want to solve. Be polite and concise. When you ask for advice, always try to thank people who give you advice. Even if the advice doesn't help you, thank them for their thoughtful reply as a courtesy for the time they took to help you. "In my situation, I don't think that advice will help me but I'm glad you posted. Thank you for offering your help!" Conversely, try not to offer advice unless asked. If you are unsure, you could say, "Can I give you advice about that?"

####Should I post my question in the Daily Help Thread or on the Main AB page?

In general, a rule of thumb is that simple questions are best in the Daily Help Thread, and complex discussion questions belong in AB Main Page. If you think a question has probably been asked on AB many times before, it should be posted in the Daily Help Thread. We like to welcome participation, and we consider posts and questions to be good things for our community.  If your question is about establishing a routine or seeking individualized recommendations, those questions need to be in the Daily Help Thread.  Routine questions and posts seeking individual recommendations will be deleted with a message encouraging their posters to use the Daily Help Thread.  These deletions shouldn't be taken personally - we try to run a tidy ship and we want you in the place where you'll get the best help and support.

**Post in the Daily Help Thread if you have:**

* Simple skin concerns
* A question you expect has been answered on AB before many times
* A BB/CC/Cushion recommendation request
* Simple questions about fakes
* Simple questions about popular ingredients
* Simple/Beginner routine help
* Questions about troubleshooting routines/breakouts/results
* Specific questions about common products

**Post in the Main AB Page if you have:**

* Questions about uncommon ingredients
* Complex questions about simple ingredients
* Specific questions about uncommon products
* Questions that inspire discussion
* A problem that you posted in a Daily at least 24 hours old no one answered (Please state that in your post)
* You have special circumstances or concerns that complicate an otherwise simple question
* You aren't sure which place to post - You are probably overthinking it

**When in doubt, you can always post in the Daily Help Thread FIRST, and if you get no response/incomplete help that means you should definitely post in the main page.**

*Clarification by /u/kittypaw [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4qdof8/automatic_post_flairing_and_daily_help_thread/?st=j22wuq30&sh=a03609ac)

**The following should go in the daily help thread:**

* Questions about your routine
 * “Where does this AHA go in my routine?”

* Questions on how to use a product
 * “Should I leave my sheet mask on for over 30 minutes?”

* Product suggestions for user-specific problems
 * “How do I get rid of my CC’s? Here’s a picture/description.”

* Asking if anyone has heard of a brand/product
 * “Has anyone heard of the brand SnailBees? Are they good?”

* Asking for product recommendations
 * “I’m going to Japan in a month! What should I get?”

* Questions with a simple answer
 * “Does my SnailBees cushion refill fit into any other cushion case?”

**May have its own thread:**

* Asking about good products for a problem in general
 * “What is your best product for fighting hyperpigmentation?”

* Discussions on brands and products
 * “What’s your favorite product from SnailBees?”

* Topics that generate discussion among the community


###Rants, Raves, Mini Reviews - Saturday & Sunday
A great place to share and chat about products without having to go deep and write a serious review. Just cheer your faves, and jeer your “holy fails”. Simple!

###Glam Day/FOTD - Monday

We noticed that compared with other beauty subs, we had a shortage of FOTDs posted and wanted to encourage people to do so. Based on feedback, people seemed shy about this, so we thought a weekly thread might help encourage posts. FOTDs are still allowed on the main page. :)

Following the selfie rule. Any selfies with no content belong in the selfie thread. Selfies that follow the selfie rule are allowed in the main thread. We will also be starting a new topic called "AB Journal" where users can post their AB progress in an individual main thread. More about this later. Progress pictures, reviews, and stories are allowed any day of the week and do not need to follow the selfie rule.


###Discovery - Tuesday
Share new product releases and AB discoveries in one place. This is not a place to share sale/deal updates.

###Hauls, Destashing- Wednesday
This is a great place to share your hauls. Hauls are still allowed on the main page, but some people find it helpful to talk and share hauls together.

Destashing is a helpful way to collect all of the AB stash sales together, and also talk to people less formally, or gauge interest before posting your whole stash to /r/asianbeautyexchange.

### Unique Discussion - Thursday

This day will host a variety of topics including, City Travel Guides, Long Term Skincare Series, Product Review by Category, AB Court of Justice ( thank you u/evilia3 https://www.reddit.com/user/evilia3) and more

###Weekly Roundup -  Friday

A weekly summary of our other discussion threads as well as the top posts in the subreddit.



###A Note about stickies:
Because we can only have two things stickied at once, we may UNSTICKY something to make room in certain cases. Most of our schedule will be consistent, but changes may occur temporarily as needed.

##Regular (/r/AsianBeauty main) posts


###About Post Flair:

You can flair your own posts! Flair makes your post’s purpose more clear, and it is filterable for users who want to avoid or find specific kinds of posts. They also reflect the most common types of posts you might see on AB, but they are by no means “the only types of posts allowed.” We agree with many people that perhaps more should be added as the sub grows, and we consider flairs an important part of our sub functions.


###Hauls:
Please post photos with products easily visible. Take multiple photos and post an imgur album if you need to.

Please list the products you purchased (including brand name and product name). We prefer that you post a comment with a full list of the products within 1 hour of posting. While some people find it helpful to list what you paid for your items, that is optional, and you are not obligated to do that.


###Fluff:
This is a brand-new category this year. We instated fluff to allow folks to filter content that while relevant to the sub in some way, may not provide a lot of discussion. The post might just be fun, and we encourage that. Memes, sheet mask photos, culture/mascot related topics, etc. are all under the providence of fun. Be mindful that some of the fun is played a lot, and if you find your post downvoted below zero, it could be because it's just done too much. We welcome you to create!

###Review:
This counts all reviews, including photostories, text reviews, blogs, youtube, instagram, serious reviews, and mini reviews. We ask that all reviews that are sponsored, paid, or review products that were provided for free to disclose that. In text posts, please include the disclaimer in the text, and for non-text posts leave a comment containing that information within 15 minutes of posting. This is to maintain the trust in reviews here on AB, and will help your reputation because people will see that you are transparent and upfront. Some users prefer to have a disclosure in the title.

We also enjoy great titles with reviews. You should list the brand name and the full product name for easier searching. Do your best! We love reviews.

###PSA:
A very broad category, but much loved. Your posts should be information people should have. Common PSAs include meet-up notices (of all kinds), sales or coupon codes on popular AB products sites, new product announcements, big changes in the Asian beauty world, or other details you can imagine the sub should know. Double posts will be removed.

###Question:
We love questions. A core feature of AB will always be the asking of questions, and the search for answers. Without that, there is no skincare journey. Try to be specific when asking questions, and you may want to include your skin type, the country you live in, or other factors involved in your question. If you think your question might be easy to answer, or has probably been asked many times before in the 3-year history of AB, consider posting in our Daily Thread. It has a ridiculously high response rate. If you're not sure, see our guidelines on "Should I post my question in the Daily Help Thread, or on the Main AB page?"


**Discussion or question?**
Compared to discussion, questions typically resolve with one answer. Discussions are usually more open-ended.

Examples:
Question: "What sheet mask should I use to help fade hyperpigmentation?"
Discussion: "What are your favorite sheet masks that fade hyperpigmentation?"

###Discussion:
Sometimes, discussions are based on a question, or a topic, brand, or product type. Sometimes they are deep, sometimes they provide excellent crowdsourcing. Sometimes they are what we label a post we can't categorize elsewhere. Nonetheless, they can generate chat and will pull in all kinds of answers from all over the subreddit.

####Discussion Guidelines by /u/neverinne
First, post a brief introduction. Imagine you're talking to a group of friends whose opinion you want on a topic they're not very familiar with.

Examples: Posting about a brand? Tell us what the brand message is and what sort of products they're famous for. Ingredient? What it's good for, is it easy to find, is it currently gaining traction. Science behind skincare? Explain it in layman terms. Starting a debate? Give us "pro" and "con". A type of product? Why such formulations are popular. And so on.

Secondly, go into more detail (if necessary).

Examples: Posting about a brand, or formulations for dry/oily/etc skin? Give us an overview of some famous products with descriptions and purchase links. Ingredient, science? Talk about studies and findings. And so on.

If you have a relevant personal story/experience or if one inspired your post, go ahead and include it. However, make sure your discussion is relevant to others as well (again, imagine a group of friends!). Intro post can be about you, but not the discussion it prompts.

Some tips:

1. Be general. "Cleansing balms are great if you find oils too runny. Some popular ones are (...) What are your favorites?" as opposed to "I personally love cleansing balms! Give me some recommendations!" The former opens up a conversation that welcomes and benefits all interested members - that's what discussion posts are about. The latter is self-serving - that's what the Daily Help thread is for.
2. Asking a direct question at the end is a good way to encourage discussion. "So, what do you think about Innisfree? What are your favorites, and is there anything you're looking forward to trying?"
3. Your post doesn't have to be super long. You don't have to follow these guidelines to a T; they're here to give you an idea of what constitutes a discussion and give you some pointers if you're not sure how to start one.


###Swatches/FOTD:
Having a tag that helps filter all of the swatch posts can be handy when choosing pigmented products/makeup. We like to make that information easier to find, and we love such posts. When writing your title, please include at least the brands you are swatching, and if possible, the type of makeup, and the product name. It makes the post more searchable.

We love FOTD, but we do have fewer than other beauty subs and we want to make it easier for people to make these posts. Typically a FOTD is a shot of your own face, to showcase makeup, or here on AB to show glowing radiant skin. FOTDs inspire us, and also empower us to love our own faces. Until they are more popular, we don't have special posting rules on FOTD (besides the photo having to be your own face). Best practices for such posts include hosting photos through Imgur, disclosing photoshop or filtering in your title, and listing what products you used for your makeup looks or your current routine for skin pics. In the future, if we find the number of FOTD increasing, we'll ask that the best practices be followed as posting rules, but for now, we just want you to get your faces out there. Sheet mask photos are fluff, not FOTD.

###Mod Posts:
We occasionally need to communicate with the sub and we use mod post tags to authenticate the post as being from moderators while making the posts easier to find. Some of our posts are considered "Mod" only. The posts can be filtered for ease of use.

###Meetups
Do you have a specific plan to meetup? List your event! You can also remind people about an upcoming event, search for locals who might be interested in hosting an event, or reminisce over past events (including photos, hauls, store reviews). This is also a good place to make friends in your local area, or coordinate for a group buy.  We are exploring building out a more detailed offering for meetups in addition to sidebar updates.


####Mod-only posts:

* Mod communication/announcements
* Scheduled threads (Daily, weekly, monthly, etc)
* Megathreads
* Meta-chats (if you have concerns or ideas, you can message the mods and propose topics for the next monthly meta-chat thread)

####Megathreads:
The mods regularly create and sticky Megathreads. These are posts that gather a lot of answers together, also known as crowdsourcing. We find this helps ALL users, both total newbies and advanced users. With all info put together in one place we can gather fantastic data for our skincare journeys and contribute to the sub together.

####Routine
Find your skin twins! See what other products people are using, and what order. Fantastic crowdsourcing info. Please follow posting guidelines or your post may be removed.

####Holy Grail
In the beauty community, we say that something is a "Holy Grail" when it is essential for you. Share your most valued products and why they are great for you. It's helpful to list similar products you tried and why you prefer your HG instead.

####Holy Fail
In contrast to “Holy Grail,” these are products that super did not work for you.

####Swatch Comparison
Fantastic opportunity to swatch products and create a mini repertoire of data for others.

####Best and Worst
This is for all Asian Beauty brands! List your best finds from a specific brand and/or your worst flops. Inquiring minds need to know. :)

#Posting Rules
All conduct guidelines and regular AB rules apply

**In addition, we will remove**

* Double posts
* Broken Links
* Posts that mention unsupported sellers (you may edit your post or repost with the seller name removed)
* Hauls without photos
* Business posts not approved by the mods
* Business posts where the user does not have business flair
* Spam
* External links without a description comment
* External links with inadequate description comment
* Self-promotion posts that violate 1:10 rule or 2x a week maximum rule
* Posts and comments that contain undisclosed affiliate links

##External links
ANY external link (except Imgur links, as they are integrated into reddit) MUST have a comment posted that describes the link. Imgur links should have descriptions with the photo or a comment on the post. If you own the site you are linking to, or you created the content, you MUST disclose this. If you are writing about a product, you MUST say how you acquired it. If you have been paid to write the post, you must say so.

**Bad:**

Link says, "A review on X brand lip scrub"

Comment says, "My review, please read it. Have you tried it? what do you think?"

**Okay:**

Link says, "A review on x brand lip scrub"

Comment says, "I spent about 2 weeks trying out the lip scrub, and I quite liked it. I think it is very good for solving flaky lips many of us have. Have you tried it? What do you think? The item was purchased by me and this is my own website and the post was not sponsored."

**Better:**

Link says, “A review on x brand lip scrub (not sponsored, product purchased by me)”

Comment says, “Tried the lip scrub for 2 weeks, and I liked it because it made my lips soft but didn’t irritate them. I would say this isn’t the best lip scrub I could imagine but it worked like it advertised and I would purchase it again. Have you tried this yourself? What are lip scrubs you like? This item was purchased by me and this is my own blog and the post was unsponsored.”

##Business posts
Except in response to questions from users, you should never post representing a business without permission from the mods for each posting. A business using AB must apply for mandatory business flair even if you do not plan to promote your business on AB. Business flair verifies you as the business you claim to be. If you have business flair and you want to promote anything related to your business, you must have mod approval for each post or comment you want to make. You are free to answer customer questions if you have business flair.

Market research for potential business, or projects that might lead to business are required to follow business rules. If you are not a business and posting something that may look like market research, please state that your project is not to make money.

Unless a user has business flair you have no way of knowing if they actually represent the business they claim to. Report posts that are promoting a business that do not say they are mod approved or have a mod comment within a reasonable time of the posting.

***

#Anything else I should consider?

##Relating to AB itself:
Asian beauty is just a tool. There will be parts of AB that are better for some people, and not others. We can all agree that we should avoid "AB is superior" tones, because this isn’t necessarily true. AB saved a lot of our skin, but many still use western products too. Products work because of formula, not origin. We should always choose what is best for us, and remember that can mean a diverse range of products and sources.

##Relating to Fashion and Beauty posts, Celebrity Photos, Inappropriate content:
We think more fashion/beauty posts would be great. For this to work, we must allow celeb photos, as celebrities heavily influence the fashion world as trendsetters. When you reduce a person to a race, or sexual desirability, we do not feel this is appropriate for this sub, and it's best if you can think of a deeper reason to express appreciation for their qualities. When celeb posts come up some will be okay and some won't. For example,

**Not Okay:**

"OMG Asians are so gorgeous", "Japan is beauty!", "Chinese women like Fan Bing Bing are so sexy just look at this", "Korean women never age", "Indian women are so pretty I can't even look at them."

**Better:**

"Fan Bing Bing's fashion is totally on point at the award show", "I love [this very famous drama] and [this very famous actress] has fantastic style in it", "I want to do my makeup like [this very famous model] in this particular photo"

##Relating to Western Products/Non-AB products:
Because our sub is focused on Asian Beauty, that is the core group of products we will be discussing and suggesting. However, western products are not prohibited from being included in this discussion! Many users have western products in their routine, whether they are new to AB or advanced routine masters. It’s good to use what works best for you, and above all else, that is the mantra we want to encourage when it comes to skincare. However, you should come in expecting to discuss AB products and realize that western product suggestions are not in the forefront. If you are looking specifically for a western product, it might be considered out of the scope of our subreddit or off-topic. Please use your good judgment (we trust you guys!) to decide when it’s appropriate to bring up western products and know that AB products are the primary focus of our community.

**Examples of when mentioning western products is appropriate:**

* You want routine help and your routine includes Western products. You will probably get mostly AB suggestions and you are happy with that.
* You use Western products that have actives that are hard to get in AB and are suggesting the product to someone.
* You have a question about Western products that stem from AB (such as Maybelline BB cream, or Estee Lauder cushion products)
* You post a FOTD and your makeup look includes some western products, and some AB products.
* You post a haul, and you bought some Western products and some AB products.
* You want to have meaningful discussion and all or part of the conversation regards a Western comparison or question.
* Occasional dermatology/curology references and progress

**Examples of when western products are not appropriate:**

* You ask a question such as “Which Aveeno Moisturizer should I buy”
* You want western product suggestions for your routine
* Your post a haul or FOTD with only western products
* You post a link to sales or coupons for western brands

##Relating to Skincare:
While we are not a skincare sub, it is a huge part of our community. Many of us got into AB through our interest in skincare. We like that people are here because they feel safe asking questions in AB, and we should be flattered that people feel comfortable posting here. With that said, as the sub moves forward, it makes sense that we establish a few common guidelines.
We should emphasize that there are no shortcuts in the skincare journey. We can't just expect solutions quickly, especially if our problems are complex.

We are not doctors. We should clearly ask people with medical problems to seek medical advice from experts, not us.
We may want everyone to post perfectly, but if we expect that, our community will shrink to only those people. A community doesn't survive by shrinking. We want new people to learn and join in.

If skincare posts overwhelm the sub, new rules or guidelines may need to be created in order to maintain the AB atmosphere. We currently do not feel this is an issue.

## Relating to Downvoting:

Downvoting doesn't really solve anything, because if a post is violating the rules, it should be reported. If it isn't breaking the rules and you disagree with the content, consider articulating your view politely in a comment to encourage discussion, or just scroll past it. The downvote button is not a disagree button. You can also use the hide function to hide posts that you don't want to see.


## Sub Policing:

We like to keep the sub clean of spam, dishonest behavior, harassment, and uncivil behavior. But we do not see much value in policing other types of behavior because such attention to negativity has and will create hostility and an unfriendly atmosphere for the sub.

We think there is more value to appreciating people for doing things right, and ignoring and scrolling past people who do things in ways you don't like. We value positive reinforcement as our teaching guide. If someone is breaking the rules, please report the post or comment. It is always helpful to include a reason for the report.

**Try the Search Bar:**

We like it when users are able to search the sub, but we don't police them toward that end. We feel that there are more helpful ways to engage in the community than to check their diligence.

Even polite comments like "Have you done a search for the answer to your question?" could in some cases make someone feel stupid for asking, so it might be more tactful to look for other ways to answer. For example,  you could do a search and post what you found in your search. Remember, though, you are under no obligation to help anyone. Do what you think is best.

If you think they are rude or didn’t put any effort in, just do not give them any attention. You don’t have to feel obligated to help everyone. THEY must learn to figure out how to get answers. It is the user’s responsibility to put some effort in to get the results they desire. There are many reasons someone might not use the search bar. Searching using Reddit is notoriously difficult, but it is also the user's responsibility to put some effort in to get the experiences they want. The bottom line, though, is you don't have to help everyone who asks. If don’t feel like helping, that is completely okay, and you should scroll past.


**Read the sidebar:**

Our sidebar is very rich in resources, but it is not a replacement for discussion and input from our users. It is not an authority for skincare or AB products. If you want to help someone and know their answer is in one of the resources in the sidebar, you can mention the link and point them in the right direction! It is more helpful than referencing them to the sidebar in general, which can sometimes feel like a discouragement of conversation. Some mobile apps make the sidebar difficult to access. It's not as intuitive for some people as it might be for others. New users may also have trouble processing all the new information, since AB has quite the learning curve. It is never a problem to copy information from the sidebar in a comment. It is freely available for that purpose. If the person just seems lazy or bothersome, scroll past. Nobody is obligated to help if they do not want to do so!.

##Kindness toward newbies, kindness toward reddit "mistakes:"

Many people only joined reddit so they can be on AB. We should be flattered! Reddit can be a tough place sometimes, unfortunately, and here at AB we do try to buck that trend, but we can't do it without the help of the community. Because a lot of our users do not know all of the Reddit norms, they will make mistakes. We know it is tempting to punish them for it (especially when it looks malicious), but we please ask our users to resist the temptation. You may leave your thoughts in a comment or PM, helping them to learn, and you should always report rule-breaking (with an explanation in the report). If you do not want to, you can always scroll past.

**If you are a newbie:**

Please try your best to be patient with yourself while you learn Reddit. This place is awesome but takes some time to get familiar with the culture and rules. You may make mistakes, you may encounter friction. Try not to take it personally. People are just looking out for the sub. If you're scared to participate, lurk for a while. A great first post would be in our daily thread, or random chat weekend, as those are more "anything goes" type of arenas. We always try to make AB a safe place to ask questions and to share your experiences, and the mods always welcome feedback related to that.

Try to be respectful, and thank those who help you. Try to read our rules and do your best to be a self-teacher. You can’t expect shortcuts on your skincare journey.

**Handholding:**

If you want to post, a great way to do that is by saying that you need a "handhold" and being upfront about the help you feel you need. AB can recognize that you just need to overcome courage barriers or perhaps are stuck on the overwhelming nature of AB. You are not obligated to help a handhold request, but you can always ask for one!


##Fantastic content:

If you see something great, say so! Tell the person in a comment or pm. Upvote! This will encourage valuable contributions to the sub. We have so many users who are advanced and have so much to offer, and they do so out of the goodness of their hearts. Without giving thanks how can we expect them to do more?

If you do not see content that you like, why not post some? Why wait for someone else to provide it? If you have been here a long time, and want good content you might consider being the influential person who posts it. We are always looking for great material for the sidebar, and as we evolve our resources, material diversity is key.

You don’t have to be an expert to post great content in the sub. Share your own experiences, try something out, talk about what you’ve learned. Even a new person can offer much. You never know what will help other people or what will strike a chord.
