# /r/AsianBeauty Rules & Community Conduct

Welcome to /r/AsianBeauty!

##Philosophy of the Sub

Reddit is a magical place. If you can dream it, there's a sub of it. (Sometimes we wish we didn't have such a good imagination.) And for all of the benefits of the open community of Reddit, we also understand that Reddit can be a very intimidating place.

AB’s goal is to create a pocket of the community where kindness, generosity, and a learning atmosphere are all cultivated. Our goal is to create an inclusive environment where all users can have a good experience; we want everyone to feel welcome. This includes both experienced users and new users, both to AB and Reddit itself. Because we have such a wide spectrum of experiences and personalities, we’d like to encourage everyone to show empathy to the people they speak to on the subreddit. This small practice has gone a long way in making our subreddit such a memorable place for a lot of people, and we’d love to continue this tradition as we grow.

Just as important as the kind and welcoming aspect of the community, is the open and teaching atmosphere. Regardless of where you are in your AB journey, whether you are a newbie or long-term user, we welcome you. We welcome questions, and we forgive mistakes. We hope that people will see the value of civil discussion and grow from the views and perspectives of our AB community. This space will always be a place of learning for everyone.

We accept that this is somewhat strange and may create confusion sometimes, or even friction. For that reason we have written our rules to help clarify. We think the results of this sub philosophy are worth it and we are glad to have you here. Thank you for reading!

# **Rules and Guidelines**

Violating any of the following rules may result in post removals, a temporary ban or warning, messages from the mods, or in rare cases, bans.


## ALL users

**Rules:**

1. No distributing personal information.  This includes name, address, phone number or links to websites that provide that information (e.g. Facebook). This is a Reddit rule.
2. No harassment, stalking or threats, regardless of whether it is in public or private messages.
3. No spam (please read [this](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) reddit wiki for more information of what constitutes spam).
4. No hate speech. This includes but is not limited to racism, sexism and homophobia.
5. No vote manipulation. Same examples are cross-subreddit brigading or paying for upvotes.
6. Anyone who consistently exhibits disruptive behavior is not welcome.
7. Affiliated Links or Referral Links must be **fully disclosed** within the title of an external link, or if a text post, fully disclosed in the text.
7a.  Like wise all discount/freebie-for-review relationships with must be disclosed.
8. ALL external links including Imgur links (even if they are not your own content) MUST contain a comment adequately describing the content of the link. This comment must be posted within 15 minutes or the link will be removed. We have no way of knowing whose content you are posting, and this way you will not be mistaken for spam. This also assists our friends accessing Reddit via mobile.
9. Related to the above -- all haul posts must have a list of the products shown in the pictures; all FOTDs must have a list of products used (make-up and/or routine, as relevant). These lists alone can fulfill the above requirement (in rule 8) for these specific kind of posts. You do not have to list samples :)
10. All Routine Help questions and individual recommendation requests must go in the Daily Help Thread.

**Guidelines:**

 Violating any of the following guidelines may result in post removals, a temporary ban, or warning.

* Most posts will be 100% relevant to Asian Beauty. Occasional submissions with culturally relevant content are okay if they benefit the community and are related to AB in some way.
* Exhibit courtesy and respect. Insults, rudeness and condescending behavior are discouraged.
* Be most excellent to each other.
* Also see our "Community Conduct" section!

## Self-Promotion
These rules apply to bloggers, youtubers, instagrammers, tweeters, or any personal project or research.

 [Read all about self-promotion rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/edit/blogposts)


***

## **Business Rules & Guidelines**


Businesses have special rules here. [Click here to read Business Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/businessrules) if you are a business, if you represent a business, or if you may be starting a business.

***

## SPAM

**What constitutes spam**

It's not forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, but you should consider your position conditional.

Reddit is different from any other place on the web -- first and foremost, it's about community, discussion, and sharing. Honor that and you'll love it here.

So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points.



* If your contribution to AB consists of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer.
* If over 10% of your submissions and conversations are your own site/content/affiliate links, you are a spammer.
* If people historically downvote your links below 0 (or links similar to yours), try and figure out why. Perhaps give the community a chance to get to know you first, and consider that you may need to participate in content that is not from your own site(s) to earn the trust of the community.
* If people historically upvote your links or ones like them -- and we're talking about real people here, not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you -- congratulations! It may not be spam! However, you still need to follow the guidelines for self promotion.
* If nobody's submitted a link like yours before, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) about it. But don't flood the subreddit if you don't see it appear in the "new" tab. It may be caught in automod, and you can always ask the mods to check.
* To play it safe if you're unsure, just [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) and find out if your content would be appropriate. (We will appreciate the notice).

**This sounds like a lot of work! I don't have the time to get to know Reddit and participate this way!**

You might want to buy a sponsored headline instead. You can spend as little as $5 and target subreddits that are relevant to your site or project. Click here for more information: http://www.reddit.com/advertising

**But it's not spam! I worked hard on that, I make no money from it, it's original content! I'm not a spammer!**

We're not making a judgement on your quality, just your behavior on /r/asianbeauty. Your stuff's probably amazing and someone would be really interested in it, but if you submit mostly your own links and your presence on AB is mostly for your self-promotion of your brand, page, blog, app, or business, you are more likely to be a spammer than you think!

##Reporting
The report button, shown on all links and comments, is an anonymous way for you to send feedback to the moderators that something is violating the rules. Always give a reason for your report, it might not be as obvious as you think. If your reason for reporting is time-sensitive, please leave a reply or send a private [message to the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) letting them know.

**What happens when something gets reported?**

It will be reviewed, either by a person or a program. The more people who report it, the more likely some action will be taken. After a certain number of reports, posts may be automatically removed by the automod. Reporting suspected spam is the single most important thing a user can do to help keep the sub clean.

**I'm upset, something I reported is still up.**

The mods may not have been able to deal with the post yet or the mods have determined the content does not violate the rules. Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) if you have concerns.

## **Problem Users**

Help make our community better by following these suggestions.

1. If you see a user breaking the rules, please report it to the moderators by clicking the report button below their post or [send us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) through the link on the sidebar.
2. Refrain from responding to provocation, exchanging insults or otherwise escalating tension.
3. Downvote posts and comments that are not constructive or do not contribute to the conversation. Don't downvote a comment an otherwise acceptable post or comment just because you disagree or wish to punish someone.

***

##MODS

**Moderator Conduct**

1. Accepting money or gifts in exchange for privileges is not allowed.
2. Banning a member without providing a reason is not allowed.
3. We will continue to shape /r/asianbeauty to be welcoming, informative, and enjoyable for our community.


**Moderator Limits:**

* We can only have two things stickied at a time.
* We can not shadowban or unshadowban someone.
* We are not Reddit employees or admins. We are unpaid volunteers who love AB.
* We cannot control downvotes or see who cast them.

**The sub sucks! It has something I don't like:**

We do our best to optimize the sub for everyone's use but some people will always want things their way.

* Use flair filters to optimize your Reddit experience
* Use the search bar functions to look for content you want
* Use the hide function to hide posts you don't want to see
* Report posts that violate the rules
* Praise and upvote content you DO like.

#FAQ

**Why isn't my post showing up?**

Sometimes reddit filters or our own filters at AB mistake content for spam. [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) and we can usually fix it. If your content violates the rules, we are happy to explain, but will not approve the post. Occasionally, users are "Shadowbanned" and all of their posts are considered spam by default.

**What is Shadowbanning? Why did you shadowban me?**

Shadowbanning is a controversial reddit practice. Subreddits, and mods cannot affect this, only Reddit Admins can. We did not Shadowban you. There are many reasons for it, as well as methods of becoming UNshadowbanned. Read here for more: /r/shadowban, /r/shadowbanned

**If you have another question for the FAQ [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty). The FAQ is a living document and we will answer your question and add it here.**
