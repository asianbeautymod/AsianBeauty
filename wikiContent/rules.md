# /r/AsianBeauty Rules & Community Conduct

Welcome to /r/AsianBeauty!

##Philosophy of the Sub

Reddit is a magical place. If you can dream it, there's a sub of it. (Sometimes we wish we didn't have such a good imagination.) And for all of the benefits of the open community of Reddit, we also understand that Reddit can be a very intimidating place.

AB’s goal is to create a pocket of the community where kindness, generosity, and a learning atmosphere are all cultivated. Our goal is to create an inclusive environment where all users can have a good experience; we want everyone to feel welcome. This includes both experienced users and new users, both to AB and Reddit itself. Because we have such a wide spectrum of experiences and personalities, we’d like to encourage everyone to show empathy to the people they speak to on the subreddit. This small practice has gone a long way in making our subreddit such a memorable place for a lot of people, and we’d love to continue this tradition as we grow.

Just as important as the kind and welcoming aspect of the community, is the open and teaching atmosphere. Regardless of where you are in your AB journey, whether you are a newbie or long-term user, we welcome you. We welcome questions, and we forgive mistakes. We hope that people will see the value of civil discussion and grow from the views and perspectives of our AB community. This space will always be a place of learning for everyone.

We accept that this is somewhat strange and may create confusion sometimes, or even friction. For that reason we have written our rules to help clarify. We think the results of this sub philosophy are worth it and we are glad to have you here. Thank you for reading!

# **Subreddit Rules and Guidelines**

Violating any of the following rules may result in warnings, post removals, a temporary 30 day ban, a temporary 60 day ban, or (in rare cases) longer or permanent bans. Bans and warnings are issued on a case-by-case basis; this varies based on the type and severity of the offense. Unless the account we are removing is an obvious spam/troll/throwaway account (e.g. recently created, used primarily to spam/troll the sub), we always issue at least one warning before banning someone, as we understand mistakes happen.

Mods will usually issue comments, PMs, or both upon post removal. We regret that sometimes it will not be possible to do so when there is a high volume of rule-breaking posts.

If you believe a post was removed by mistake, [please PM the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty)

## Self-Promotion
These rules apply to bloggers, youtubers, instagrammers, tweeters, or to your personal project or research.

 [Read all about self-promotion rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/blogposts)

## **Business Rules & Guidelines**


Businesses have special rules here. [Click here to read Business Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/businessrules) if you are a business, if you represent a business, or if you may be starting a business.

***

## SPAM

**What constitutes spam**

It's not forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, but you should consider your position conditional.

Reddit is different from any other place on the web -- first and foremost, it's about community, discussion, and sharing. Honor that and you'll love it here.

So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points.



* If your contribution to AB consists of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer.
* If over 10% of your submissions and conversations are your own site/content/affiliate links, you are a spammer.
* If people historically downvote your links below 0 (or links similar to yours), try and figure out why. Perhaps give the community a chance to get to know you first, and consider that you may need to participate in content that is not from your own site(s) to earn the trust of the community.
* If people historically upvote your links or ones like them -- and we're talking about real people here, not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you -- congratulations! It may not be spam! However, you still need to follow the guidelines for self promotion.
* If nobody's submitted a link like yours before, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) about it. But don't flood the subreddit if you don't see it appear in the "new" tab. It may be caught in automod, and you can always ask the mods to check.
* To play it safe if you're unsure, just [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) and find out if your content would be appropriate. (We will appreciate the notice).
* if a post is removed for not complying with other post/sub rules and is reposted by another user aka circumventing post rules will be marked as spam and not allowed

**This sounds like a lot of work! I don't have the time to get to know Reddit and participate this way!**

You might want to buy a sponsored headline instead. You can spend as little as $5 and target subreddits that are relevant to your site or project. Click here for more information: http://www.reddit.com/advertising

**But it's not spam! I worked hard on that, I make no money from it, it's original content! I'm not a spammer!**

We're not making a judgement on your quality, just your behavior on /r/asianbeauty. Your stuff's probably amazing and someone would be really interested in it, but if you submit mostly your own links and your presence on AB is mostly for your self-promotion of your brand, page, blog, app, or business, you are behaving in a way that will look like spam.

##Reporting
The report button, shown on all links and comments, is an anonymous way for you to send feedback to the moderators that something is violating the rules. Always give a reason for your report, it might not be as obvious as you think. If your reason for reporting is time-sensitive, please leave a reply or send a private [message to the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) letting them know.

**What happens when something gets reported?**

It will be reviewed, either by a person or a program. The more people who report it, the more likely some action will be taken. After a certain number of reports, posts may be automatically removed by the automod. Reporting suspected spam is the single most important thing a user can do to help keep the sub clean.

**I'm upset, something I reported is still up.**

The mods may not have been able to deal with the post yet or the mods have determined the content does not violate the rules. Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) if you have concerns.

## **Problem Users**

Help make our community better by following these suggestions.

1. If you see a user breaking the rules, please report it to the moderators by clicking the report button below their post or [send us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) through the link on the sidebar.
2. Refrain from responding to provocation, exchanging insults, or otherwise escalating tension.
3. Downvote posts and comments that are not constructive or do not contribute to the conversation. Don't downvote a comment an otherwise acceptable post or comment just because you disagree or wish to punish someone.

***

##MODS

**Moderator Conduct**

1. Accepting money or gifts in exchange for privileges is not allowed.
2. Banning a community member without providing a reason is not allowed. We may or may not ban throwaway accounts, spammers, or bots without reason.

* Use flair filters to get rid of types of posts you don’t want to see
* Use the search bar functions to look for content you want [link to tutorial]
* Use the hide function to hide posts you don't want to see

#FAQ  

**Why isn't my post showing up?**

Sometimes Reddit filters or our own filters at AB mistake content for spam. [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty) and we can usually fix it. If your content violates the rules, we are happy to explain, but will not approve the post. Occasionally, users are "Shadowbanned" and all of their posts are considered spam by default.

**What is shadowbanning? Why did you shadowban me?**

Shadowbanning is a controversial Reddit practice. Subreddits and mods cannot affect this, only Reddit admins can. We did not shadowban you. There are many reasons for it, as well as methods of becoming UNshadowbanned. Read here for more: /r/shadowban, /r/shadowbanned

**If you have another question for the FAQ [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeauty). The FAQ is a living document and we will answer your question and add it here.**
