#Social Media Flair

For the mods to add a custom social media flair for you, we need some "proof", just to make sure you are the content owner.

You can add a sentence like "I am also on Reddit and /r/asianbeauty!" at the end of your latest post. For those of you who are too shy to let others know that you are on Reddit then simply use "美容护肤" (beauty and skincare in Chinese) at the end of your post. You can also add this into a profile for instagram, twitter, etc.  Once you've added the above please send the link to the moderator mail and once your flair is added, feel free to edit it out.


Please note that **only applicable social media accounts that are related to Asian Beauty will be granted flairs**. If your blog/instagram/tumblr/etc is about your lifestyle and fashion then chances are you won't be getting a flair.
