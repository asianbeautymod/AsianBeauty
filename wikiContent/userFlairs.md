##Shade

*Note: if you prefer not to disclose your skintone, you may select 'N/A', but please keep in mind that it will be needed to help with base makeup recommendations (BB and CC creams, Cushions, etc)*

For good or ill, Mac has become the most widely used categorizing system used when hunting down BB and CC creams. Mac uses a reverse of the normal undertone system, where NC = yellow and NW = pink. (Some think of this as NC = Not Cool, and NW = Not Warm.)

**Finding your Mac shade:**
If you have a Mac counter near you, it's best to go get matched in person. However! Have them match your neck, not your face, as it's common for your face to be 1-3 shades off from your neck, leaving you with either a 'ghost face' or 'reverse eagle' when compared to the rest of you.

If you don't have a Mac near you, if you have a current foundation that matches you, you can use [findation](http://findation.com/) and [Temptalia's Foundation Matrix](http://www.temptalia.com/foundation-matrix) to reverse-engineer your Mac shade using your current products.

**But wait, my skin shade changes in the winter/summer!** No worries, just re-enter new data into the Google Form and weâ€™ll update it for you.

##Trouble

Basically, what your skin concerns are. Currently, the 'trouble' categories are:

**Aging** - wrinkles, sagging, anti-aging
**Acne** - Acne, acne prevention, acne-prone skin
**Pigmentation** - PIH, sun damage, uneven skin tone, age spots
**Redness** - Rosacea, PIE, flushed skin
**Dullness** - dull, rough, and uneven skin texture, flaky patches
**Pores** - sebum, large pores, clogged pores

*Note on Pigmentation and Redness: Please read /u/ecologista 's [Rosacea and Redness](http://redd.it/2hfudg) post to help identify which Trouble term you should use.*

If you feel there is another category we should add that doesn't logically fit within the current ones, please shoot me a message and we'll update the list!

*Note: you may choose *either 2 of "trouble" or of "type" if you wish, but not both!

##Type

Skin type is especially important when looking for and providing product recommendations.

**Oily**
**Dry**
**Combo**
**Dehydrated**
**Sensitive**
**Normal**

*Note: you may choose *either 2 of "trouble" or of "type" if you wish, but not both!

##Location

Please supply your two-digit country code, so people recommending products know what will and will not be local to you. /u/MissPicklesMeow , for example, is very tired of me suggesting things she can't get in Canada. (Sorry Pickles!)


You can find out your two-digit country code here: http://sustainablesources.com/resources/country-abbreviations/

##Getting your flair added

Due to the overwhelming popularity of flair requests, we have updated the request process to be submitted via [Google Form here.](https://goo.gl/forms/3qg5RKsgNDtZeJrs1)


The form will walk you through the information needed, exactly as outlined earlier in this post. Any submissions that do not follow the correct format will not be added.  It may take up to one week to receive your flair after submitting as we have to manually add these into the database.
