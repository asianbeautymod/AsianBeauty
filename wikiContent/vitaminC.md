#[Vitamin C Products: L-AA vs the Derivatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/67gk12/discussion_vitamin_c_products_laa_vs_the/?st=j224gn47&sh=cc1d0cd8) by /u/stressfaced

I feel like lately we’ve been seeing a lot more affordable (and also more expensive!) vitamin C products and options on the market, and there’s been an increase in questions about which is the right option for you.  Some of the more common options available, and the ones I’m going to discuss, are the following:

&nbsp;


 * L-Ascorbic Acid (L-AA)
 * Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)
 * Ascorbyl Palmitate (AP)
 * Ascorbyl Tetra-tetraisopalmitoyl (ATIP) *(also known as Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate)*
 * Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)

Vitamin C is an antioxidant, meaning that it will prevent and remove free radicals from the skin.   This is important, as these cells are damaged, often from pollution, and can age your skin by breaking down skin collagen.

&nbsp;


These vitamin C products have the capability to increase collagen production, help PIH, and treat acne.  It is an active, and while it does provide UV protection by protecting the skin from the above mentioned free radicals, it is important to use it alongside sunscreen.

###L-AA###


This is the preferred version of vitamin C derivatives.  The pros and cons of it have been discussed extensively, especially on this sub.  For in depth information on it, I recommend checking out the [Vitamin C Serum FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/).

&nbsp;


L-AA is *the* best form of vitamin C in terms of collagen production and UV protection.  So why wouldn’t you just use it?  It has a low pH (of approximately 3.5) that can cause skin irritation for some people.  It can also, in some cases, exacerbate acne.

&nbsp;


Furthermore, L-AA is unstable in liquid based solutions.  Some brands have tried to get around the instability by using powder suspended in silicone based solutions.  However, Brandon Truaxe (from DECIEM - the umbrella brand that makes The Ordinary, Hylamide and NIOD among others) has said the following regarding these solutions:


> “In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.“


This means that for TO Vitamin C Suspension 23%, your skin is potentially using 2% of the vitamin C.  This is significantly lower than L-AA’s maximum absorption rates (20%); however, Paula from Paula’s Choice claims that research has shown that concentrations as low as 0.6% will provide protection against free radicals, and have anti-aging benefits.

&nbsp;


The last thing to keep in mind if you choose L-AA - normally these products have wait times (approx. 10-20 mins) and are best used in the mornings.  This will obviously increase your morning routine times.

&nbsp;

###MAP###


MAP is a water soluble solution similar to L-AA.  Unlike L-AA, however, MAP vitamin C products are stable.  These products will be also effective at significantly lower concentrations than L-AA, and are a better product for those with sensitive skin.

&nbsp;


10% solutions of MAP are considered to be high.  However, even with these relatively “high” concentrations (in comparison to the 10-20% commonly found in L-AA), only about 2-3% vitamin C will come in contact with the skin, as MAP must be effectively converted to L-AA.  Even at the low quantities, studies have found this to be the best derivative for brightening and you only need approximately 5% MAP concentrations to even out skin tones.  Studies have also found that MAP is better than L-AA at penetrating deeper layers of the skin.

&nbsp;


MAP solutions are not pH dependent, and do not need wait times in your routine.  TO says that their emulsion will absorb in 5-10 seconds.

&nbsp;


**If you're interested in the collagen boosting properties of Vitamin C, please keep in mind that this is the only derivative that is proven to be as effective as L-AA.**

###AP and ATIP###


I’m going to talk about both AP and ATIP here because they’re very similar.  Both of these derivatives are fat-soluble.  Because of this, it may penetrate your skin worse than MAP or L-AA depending on the formula.  For these derivatives, it’s better to choose oil-based solutions (which will penetrate) as opposed to emulsions (which tend to be thicker and more creamy and these will sit on the surface of the skin).  

&nbsp;


AP is usually found in low concentrations, but it requires a low pH to perform and has more stability issues than MAP or SAP.  Furthermore, many studies cast doubt on whether AP is capable of improving collagen.

&nbsp;


Similar to AP, ATIP is also found in low concentrations (normally around 3%) and also requires a pH of about 5 to be stable.  ATIP doesn’t seem to have many benefits in comparison to other derivatives except when it comes to brightening complexions.  It's very mild on your skin, especially since it doesn't have any exfoliation properties.
 For anti aging properties, in comparison to MAP, ATIP is worse at preventing and removing free radicals - even other antioxidants like vitamin E perform better (AP will perform at least as well as vitamin E).  Furthermore, studies have found doubts that this has collagen boosting capabilities.  ATIP is also a relatively new product; there's been very few and conflicting studies into this.

&nbsp;

###SAP###


It is more difficult to find studies and documentation on SAP in comparison to the other derivatives of vitamin C.  Similar to MAP, SAP is water soluble and stable at a pH of 7 making it a decent option for sensitive skin.  SAP will also convert to ascorbic acid on your skin, unlike other derivatives such as AP (I could not find any data saying AP converts) and will have very low concentrations.

&nbsp;


SAP will stimulate collagen production, but it will not perform as well as L-AA or MAP.  It also will prevent the free radicals, but again less than MAP or L-AA.

&nbsp;


EDIT:  Sorry everyone apparently my reading comprehension is poor at 2am.  SAP is very beneficial for acne and can effectively be used  with anti-acne products like salicylic acid as outlined by both u/psithyrstes [here](http://wisderm.com/ingredients/Sodium+Ascorbyl+Phosphate#32-acne-vulgaris-treatment) and u/miclitis.
